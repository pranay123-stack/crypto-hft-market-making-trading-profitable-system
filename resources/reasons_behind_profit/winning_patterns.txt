================================================================================

PATTERN NAME: Bid-Ask Imbalance Mean Reversion
PATTERN ID: P001
CATEGORY: Market Microstructure
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-09-15
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
When the order book shows a strong imbalance (e.g., 3:1 ratio bid:ask size),
price often moves toward the larger side, but then mean-reverts within 5-30
seconds as the imbalance corrects.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Bid/Ask size ratio >3.0 or <0.33
- Imbalance sustained for >2 seconds
- Spread <5 bps (tight spread indicates healthy market)
- Normal volatility regime (VIX 15-25)
- No major news or events

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 50-80
- Occurrences per week: 250-400
- Occurrences per month: 1000-1600

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 68%
- Average profit when successful: $150
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $75
- Profit factor: 2.8
- Expected value: $78 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $89,400

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Monitor order book bid/ask sizes at top 3 levels
2. Calculate imbalance ratio = bid_size / ask_size
3. If ratio >3.0:
   - Wait for price to tick up (toward bid side)
   - Enter SHORT position
   - Exit when imbalance normalizes (ratio 0.8-1.2) or time limit
4. If ratio <0.33:
   - Wait for price to tick down (toward ask side)
   - Enter LONG position
   - Exit when imbalance normalizes or time limit

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: When imbalance ratio exceeds threshold AND price moves toward heavy side
- Position size: $25,000
- Exit condition 1 (target): Imbalance ratio returns to 0.8-1.2
- Exit condition 2 (stop-loss): Price continues in direction of imbalance >0.15%
- Exit condition 3 (time): 30 seconds elapsed

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $25,000
- Stop-loss: 0.15% (approximately $37.50)
- Time limit: 30 seconds
- Maximum daily occurrences: 50 (to avoid over-trading)

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: Normal volatility, tight spreads, liquid markets
- Avoid: High volatility (VIX >30), wide spreads (>10 bps), news events
- Optimal hours: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM (avoid open/close volatility)

EVIDENCE:
Sample Trade Log (last 10 successful trades):
Date/Time             | Symbol | Imbalance | Entry  | Exit   | P&L
----------------------|--------|-----------|--------|--------|--------
2025-11-24 10:15:23   | AAPL   | 4.2 (bid) | 150.25 | 150.18 | +$175
2025-11-24 11:32:45   | MSFT   | 0.28 (ask)| 385.50 | 385.62 | +$120
2025-11-24 13:45:12   | GOOGL  | 3.8 (bid) | 142.80 | 142.73 | +$175
[... more examples ...]

Statistical Validation:
- Tested on 3 months of historical data
- Out-of-sample win rate: 66% (vs 68% in-sample)
- Pattern remains stable across market regimes
- Statistical significance: p < 0.001 (t-test)

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $25,000 per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$75,000 per trade (before market impact increases)
- Can expand to 10-15 additional liquid symbols
- Estimated capacity: $1M-$2M deployed capital

NOTES:
- Pattern effectiveness decreases during earnings announcements
- Works best in SPY, QQQ, and large-cap stocks (AAPL, MSFT, etc.)
- Be cautious of "fake" imbalances (iceberg orders)

PATTERN NAME: Spread Widening on Low Volume
PATTERN ID: P002
CATEGORY: Market Microstructure
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-10-03
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
During periods of low trading volume (lunch hour, slow days), spreads
temporarily widen. Providing liquidity (limit orders at mid-point) captures
the spread as it returns to normal.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Trading volume <50% of normal for >5 minutes
- Spread widens to >5 bps (from normal 2-3 bps)
- Order book depth decreases >30%
- Time of day: 12:00-1:30 PM (lunch hour) or late afternoon

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 5-10
- Occurrences per week: 25-50
- Occurrences per month: 100-200

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 75%
- Average profit when successful: $85 (capture half-spread)
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $50 (adverse selection)
- Profit factor: 3.2
- Expected value: $51 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $6,800

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Monitor volume (rolling 5-minute average)
2. Monitor spread (bid-ask)
3. If volume <50% AND spread >5 bps:
   - Place limit BUY at (bid + 1 tick)
   - Place limit SELL at (ask - 1 tick)
   - Cancel after 2 minutes if not filled
   - If filled, exit when spread normalizes or time limit

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: Passive limit orders inside the spread
- Position size: $15,000 per side
- Exit: When spread returns to normal (<3 bps) OR 10 minutes elapsed
- Risk: Adverse selection (informed trader takes the other side)

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $15,000
- Stop-loss: 0.10% or $15
- Time limit: 10 minutes
- Maximum concurrent positions: 3

MARKET CONDITIONS:

- Avoid: Volatile markets, news events, market open/close
- Optimal: Friday afternoons, summer months, holiday weeks

EVIDENCE:
Performance by Time of Day:
Time Period     | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L | Total P&L
----------------|-------------|----------|---------|----------
12:00-1:00 PM   | 40          | 78%      | $90     | $3,600
1:00-2:00 PM    | 25          | 72%      | $80     | $2,000
2:00-3:00 PM    | 15          | 70%      | $75     | $1,125

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $15,000 per side
- Maximum capital: ~$40,000 per side
- Limited by low volume (can't trade too large)
- Can expand to additional symbols (10-20)

NOTES:
- This is a market-making pattern (provide liquidity)
- Requires fast execution to get good queue position
- Rebates from exchanges offset some costs

PATTERN NAME: Quote Stuffing Detection and Fade
PATTERN ID: P003
CATEGORY: Market Microstructure
DISCOVERY DATE: 2025-01-20
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
When another HFT firm "quote stuffs" (submits and cancels orders rapidly),
price often moves in the direction of the stuffing, but then quickly reverses
as the stuffing stops. We detect the stuffing, wait for the price move, then
fade it (trade opposite).

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Quote update rate >500 per second (normal is 50-100)
- Quote-to-trade ratio >100:1 (normal is 10-20:1)
- Quotes mostly on one side (buy or sell)
- Duration: 10-60 seconds
- Price moves 2-5 bps in direction of stuffing

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 10-20
- Occurrences per week: 50-100
- Occurrences per month: 200-400

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 62%
- Average profit when successful: $220
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $120
- Profit factor: 2.4
- Expected value: $90 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $27,000

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Monitor quote update frequency (quotes per second)
2. Calculate quote-to-trade ratio
3. If quote_rate >500 AND quote_to_trade >100:
   - Identify direction of stuffing (buy-side or sell-side)
   - Wait for stuffing to stop (quote rate returns to normal)
   - Wait for price to move in direction of stuffing
   - Enter OPPOSITE position (fade the move)
   - Exit when price reverts or time limit

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: After stuffing stops, price has moved, we enter opposite
- Position size: $40,000
- Exit condition 1: Price reverts 50% of the stuffing move
- Exit condition 2: Stop-loss at -0.20%
- Exit condition 3: 2 minutes elapsed

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $40,000
- Stop-loss: 0.20% ($80)
- Time limit: 2 minutes
- Maximum daily occurrences: 15

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: Normal to high volatility
- Avoid: Extremely volatile markets (stuffing may be genuine signal)
- Optimal: First hour of trading (9:30-10:30 AM)

EVIDENCE:
Validation:
- Pattern validated over 6 months
- Win rate stable at 60-65%
- Works across multiple liquid symbols
- Most profitable in AAPL, MSFT, SPY, QQQ

Example Trade:
- Quote stuffing detected at 9:45 AM in AAPL
- Quote rate spiked to 750/sec (from normal 80/sec)
- All quotes on buy-side (pushing price up)
- Price moved from $150.25 to $150.32 (+7 bps)
- Stuffing stopped at 9:46 AM
- Entered SHORT at $150.31
- Price reverted to $150.26 within 45 seconds
- Profit: +$200

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $40,000 per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$100,000 per trade
- Can expand to 5-10 symbols
- Estimated capacity: $500K-$1M

NOTES:
- Requires fast quote feed (direct from exchange)
- Need to distinguish quote stuffing from genuine liquidity provision
- Pattern less effective in low-volatility environments

PATTERN NAME: Opening Range Breakout (First 15 Minutes)
PATTERN ID: P101
CATEGORY: Temporal
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-08-10
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
In the first 15 minutes of trading (9:30-9:45 AM), price establishes a range.
Breakouts from this range (with volume confirmation) tend to continue in the
breakout direction for 30-60 minutes.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Time: 9:30-9:45 AM (establish range)
- Breakout time: 9:45-10:30 AM
- Breakout criteria: Price exceeds range by >0.10%
- Volume >150% of average for the breakout bar
- Follow-through: Price continues in breakout direction >70% of time

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 2-4 (per symbol monitored)
- Occurrences per week: 10-20
- Occurrences per month: 40-80

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. From 9:30-9:45 AM, record high and low prices (opening range)
2. From 9:45 AM onward, monitor for breakout:
   - If price >opening_high + 0.10%:
     - Check volume >150% of average
     - If yes, enter LONG position
   - If price <opening_low - 0.10%:
     - Check volume >150% of average
     - If yes, enter SHORT position
3. Hold position for 30-60 minutes or until stop-loss/target

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: On confirmed breakout (price + volume)
- Position size: $50,000
- Target: +0.30% from entry (risk:reward = 1:2)
- Stop-loss: Back inside the opening range + 0.15%
- Time stop: Exit after 60 minutes regardless

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $50,000
- Stop-loss: 0.15% ($75)
- Time limit: 60 minutes

October     | 52     | 69%      | $11,500
November    | 48     | 71%      | $10,900

False Breakouts:
- ~30% of breakouts fail (price returns to range)
- Stop-loss limits damage to acceptable levels
- Net result still profitable due to 1:2 risk:reward

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $50,000 per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$150,000 per trade (before impact)
- Can monitor 10-20 symbols simultaneously
- Estimated capacity: $1M-$2M

NOTES:
- Most effective on liquid, actively traded stocks
- Requires pre-market analysis to identify likely movers
- Can combine with news sentiment analysis for better selection

PATTERN NAME: Close Auction Reversal (Last 10 Minutes)
PATTERN ID: P102
CATEGORY: Temporal
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-11-05
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
In the last 10 minutes before market close (3:50-4:00 PM), price often
reverses intraday trends as traders close positions and closing auction
orders arrive. We fade strong intraday moves in this window.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Time: 3:50-4:00 PM
- Intraday move: >0.50% in one direction
- Closing auction imbalance published (if available)
- Low inventory (many traders flat before close)

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 3-6
- Occurrences per week: 15-30
- Occurrences per month: 60-120

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 64%
- Average profit when successful: $180
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $100
- Profit factor: 2.3
- Expected value: $79 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $7,900

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. At 3:50 PM, check intraday P&L for each symbol
2. If price moved >0.50% in one direction AND volume was elevated:
   - Enter OPPOSITE position at 3:51 PM
   - Exit at 3:59 PM (before close) or when reversal target hit
3. Position size based on confidence (higher move = higher confidence)

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: 3:51 PM, opposite direction of intraday trend
- Position size: $30,000-$60,000 (based on intraday move size)
- Target: Revert 30-50% of intraday move
- Stop-loss: Intraday move extends by additional 0.15%
- Time stop: 3:59 PM (always close before 4:00 PM)

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $30,000-$60,000
- Stop-loss: 0.15%
- Time limit: 9 minutes
- Maximum daily occurrences: 5

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: High-volume days, days with strong intraday trends
- Avoid: Days with major news at close, quarter-end rebalancing
- Optimal: Tuesday-Thursday (Mondays and Fridays less reliable)

EVIDENCE:
Performance by Day of Week:
Day         | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
------------|-------------|----------|--------
Monday      | 12          | 58%      | $65
Tuesday     | 18          | 67%      | $95
Wednesday   | 20          | 68%      | $90
Thursday    | 17          | 65%      | $85
Friday      | 13          | 60%      | $70

Success Rate by Intraday Move Size:
Move Size   | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
------------|-------------|----------|--------
0.50-0.75%  | 35          | 60%      | $70
0.75-1.00%  | 25          | 65%      | $85
1.00-1.50%  | 15          | 68%      | $95
>1.50%      | 8           | 75%      | $120

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $30K-$60K per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$100K per trade
- Limited time window (9 minutes) constrains capacity
- Can monitor 5-10 symbols

NOTES:
- Critical to exit before 4:00 PM (avoid closing auction risk)
- Use closing auction imbalance data when available (NYSE)
- Pattern less effective on triple witching days (options expiration)

2025-10-28 | -0.95%      | +0.40%     | Loss    | -$220
[... more examples ...]

Win Rate by Friday Move Size:
Friday Move | Occurrences | Monday Win Rate
------------|-------------|----------------
0.75-1.00%  | 18          | 67%
1.00-1.50%  | 12          | 72%
>1.50%      | 8           | 75%

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $75,000 per trade

PATTERN NAME: Futures-SPY Lead-Lag Arbitrage
PATTERN ID: P201
CATEGORY: Cross-Asset
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-07-15
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
S&P 500 futures (ES) typically lead SPY ETF by 50-200 milliseconds. When
futures make a significant move (>0.05%), SPY follows within 200ms. We trade
SPY in the direction of the futures move.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Lead-lag: ES futures lead SPY by 50-200ms (median: 120ms)
- Threshold: ES move >0.05% (5 bps)
- Confirmation: Move sustained for >100ms
- Spread: ES-SPY correlation >0.95 (tight relationship)

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 100-200
- Occurrences per week: 500-1000
- Occurrences per month: 2000-4000

PROFITABILITY:

- Average loss when unsuccessful: $30
- Profit factor: 4.3
- Expected value: $28.50 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $85,500

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Subscribe to ES futures tick data
2. Subscribe to SPY tick data
3. When ES moves >0.05% in <100ms:
   - Immediately enter SPY position in same direction
   - Monitor for SPY to follow (should happen within 200ms)
   - Exit when SPY catches up (spread normalizes)
   - Or exit at time limit (500ms)

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: Immediately upon ES move detection (latency critical!)
- Position size: $35,000
- Exit condition 1: SPY catches up to ES (spread <0.02%)
- Exit condition 2: Stop-loss if SPY moves opposite >0.10%
- Exit condition 3: Time limit 500ms

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $35,000
- Stop-loss: 0.10% ($35)
- Time limit: 500ms
- Maximum concurrent positions: 1 (at a time)

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: Normal to high volatility, tight ES-SPY spread
- Avoid: Market open/close (too chaotic), low liquidity
- Optimal: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM

EVIDENCE:
Lead-Lag Analysis:
ES Move Size | SPY Follow % | Avg Lag Time | Win Rate

PATTERN NAME: Sector Rotation (ETF Relative Strength)
PATTERN ID: P202
CATEGORY: Cross-Asset
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-12-01
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
When one sector ETF significantly outperforms or underperforms SPY over a
1-2 hour period, the relationship often mean-reverts within the next 2-4 hours.
We trade the sector ETF relative to SPY (pairs trade).

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Time window: 1-2 hours of divergence
- Threshold: Sector ETF +/- 0.50% vs SPY
- Correlation: Normal correlation >0.70 (but temporarily broken)
- Reversion: Usually occurs within 2-4 hours

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 3-8 (across all sectors)
- Occurrences per week: 15-40
- Occurrences per month: 60-160

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 66%
- Average profit when successful: $240
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $130
- Profit factor: 2.5
- Expected value: $111 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $13,320

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Monitor 11 sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLP, XLY, XLU, XLB, XLRE, XLC)
2. Calculate each sector's performance vs SPY (rolling 1-hour)
3. If sector outperforms SPY by >0.50% (or underperforms by >0.50%):
   - Enter pairs trade:
     - If outperforming: SHORT sector ETF, LONG SPY
     - If underperforming: LONG sector ETF, SHORT SPY
   - Exit when spread mean-reverts to <0.20% or time limit

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: When sector divergence >0.50% from SPY
- Position size: $50,000 each side (sector ETF and SPY)
- Exit condition 1: Spread reverts to <0.20%
- Exit condition 2: Stop-loss if spread widens to >0.80%
- Exit condition 3: Time limit 4 hours

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $50,000 each side ($100,000 total gross)
- Stop-loss: Spread widens to 0.80% (loss: ~$150)
- Time limit: 4 hours
- Maximum concurrent positions: 2 (different sectors)

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: Normal market conditions, no major sector-specific news
- Avoid: Earnings clusters in one sector, sector-specific events
- Optimal: Mid-day (after morning volatility settles)

EVIDENCE:
Performance by Sector:
Sector | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
-------|-------------|----------|--------
XLK    | 25          | 68%      | $125

XLV    | 20          | 65%      | $110
Others | 35          | 66%      | $108

Reversion Time Analysis:
Time to Revert | Occurrences | Win Rate
---------------|-------------|----------
<1 hour        | 30          | 72%
1-2 hours      | 45          | 68%
2-4 hours      | 35          | 64%
>4 hours       | 10          | 50% (stopped out)

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $100,000 gross per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$300,000 gross per trade
- Can trade multiple sectors simultaneously (2-3)

PATTERN NAME: 3-Sigma Price Reversion
PATTERN ID: P301
CATEGORY: Statistical
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-06-20
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
When price moves >3 standard deviations from its 20-period moving average,
it almost always reverts (mean reversion). We enter counter-trend position
and exit when price returns to 1-sigma or closer.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Price deviation: >3 standard deviations from 20-period MA
- Time frame: 1-minute bars
- No major news or events (to avoid justified breakouts)
- Normal volatility regime (VIX <30)

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 8-15
- Occurrences per week: 40-75
- Occurrences per month: 160-300

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 82%
- Average profit when successful: $195
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $110
- Profit factor: 6.0
- Expected value: $140 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $33,600

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Calculate 20-period moving average (1-min bars)
2. Calculate standard deviation (20-period)
3. Calculate current deviation: (price - MA) / std_dev
4. If deviation >3.0 (price above MA):
   - Enter SHORT position
   - Exit when deviation <1.0 or stop-loss
5. If deviation <-3.0 (price below MA):
   - Enter LONG position
   - Exit when deviation >-1.0 or stop-loss

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: When |deviation| >3.0 standard deviations
- Position size: $45,000
- Target: Price returns to 1-sigma from mean
- Stop-loss: Price continues to 4-sigma (pattern failed)
- Time stop: 15 minutes

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $45,000
- Stop-loss: 4-sigma (~0.25%)
- Time limit: 15 minutes
- Maximum daily occurrences: 12

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: Range-bound markets, normal volatility
- Avoid: Strong trending days, news-driven moves, VIX >30
- Optimal: 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM (avoid open/close)

EVIDENCE:
Win Rate by Deviation Level:
Deviation  | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
-----------|-------------|----------|--------

PATTERN NAME: Bollinger Band Squeeze Breakout
PATTERN ID: P302
CATEGORY: Statistical
DISCOVERY DATE: 2024-10-15
STATUS: Active

DESCRIPTION:
When Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2 std dev) contract to historically tight
levels (squeeze), a breakout is imminent. We enter in the direction of the
breakout when it occurs with volume confirmation.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Bollinger Band width <10th percentile (historical)
- Duration of squeeze: >10 periods (10 minutes)
- Breakout: Price closes outside bands with volume >150% average
- Continuation: 75% of breakouts continue for >0.30%

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per day: 4-8
- Occurrences per week: 20-40
- Occurrences per month: 80-160

PROFITABILITY:
- Win rate: 74%
- Average profit when successful: $310
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $155
- Profit factor: 3.5
- Expected value: $189 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $22,680

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Calculate Bollinger Bands (20-period MA, ±2 std dev)
2. Calculate band width: (upper_band - lower_band) / MA
3. Calculate band width percentile (vs last 100 days)
4. If band_width_percentile <10% AND duration >10 periods:
   - Monitor for breakout
5. If price closes above upper band with volume >150%:
   - Enter LONG position
6. If price closes below lower band with volume >150%:
   - Enter SHORT position
7. Exit at target or stop-loss

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: On confirmed breakout (price outside bands + volume)
- Position size: $60,000
- Target: +0.40% from entry
- Stop-loss: Back inside bands + 0.20%
- Time stop: 60 minutes

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $60,000
- Stop-loss: 0.20% ($120)
- Time limit: 60 minutes
- Maximum daily occurrences: 6

MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Works best: After consolidation period, before earnings/events
- Avoid: Extremely low volume, holidays
- Optimal: Normal volatility transitioning to higher volatility

EVIDENCE:
Performance by Squeeze Duration:
Duration    | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
------------|-------------|----------|--------
10-20 bars  | 45          | 71%      | $285
20-40 bars  | 40          | 76%      | $320
>40 bars    | 18          | 80%      | $360

Breakout Direction:
Direction   | Occurrences | Win Rate | Avg P&L
------------|-------------|----------|--------
Upward      | 55          | 75%      | $315
Downward    | 48          | 73%      | $305

Finding: Both directions equally reliable

False Breakouts:
- ~26% of breakouts fail and price returns inside bands
- Stop-loss limits losses to acceptable levels
- Risk:reward of 1:2 makes pattern profitable

SCALING POTENTIAL:
- Current capital: $60,000 per trade
- Maximum capital: ~$180,000 per trade
- Frequency (4-8/day) provides good capacity
- Can deploy to 15-20 symbols
- Estimated capacity: $2M-$4M

NOTES:
- Works best on stocks with regular volatility cycles
- Combine with ADX (directional strength) for confirmation
- Pattern more reliable during earnings season

After earnings announcements, stocks that beat/miss expectations often continue
to drift in the same direction for 1-3 days. We enter positions after the
initial volatility subsides (Day 1 after announcement).

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Earnings surprise: >3% beat or miss vs consensus
- Initial reaction: >4% move on announcement day
- Entry: Day 1 after announcement (after volatility settles)
- Holding period: 1-3 days

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per week: 5-15 (depends on earnings season)

PATTERN NAME: Retail FOMO Detection (Social Media Spike)
PATTERN ID: P601
CATEGORY: Behavioral
DISCOVERY DATE: 2025-03-05
STATUS: Under Validation

DESCRIPTION:
When retail trading activity spikes (detected via social media mentions,
options flow, small lot sizes), price often overshoots and then reverts.
We fade the retail FOMO by entering opposite position.

CHARACTERISTICS:
- Social media mentions: >5x normal (Twitter, Reddit, etc.)
- Options activity: Heavy call buying (retail signature)
- Small lot sizes: Increase in <100 share orders
- Price: >2% move in one session

FREQUENCY:
- Occurrences per week: 2-6
- Occurrences per month: 8-24
- Occurrences per year: ~100

- Win rate: 64% (still validating)
- Average profit when successful: $520
- Average loss when unsuccessful: $280
- Profit factor: 2.3
- Expected value: $232 per occurrence
- Total P&L (last 30 days): $4,640 (20 trades in testing)

DETECTION METHOD:
Algorithm:
1. Monitor social media (Twitter/X, Reddit WallStreetBets, StockTwits)
2. Count mentions and sentiment for each ticker
3. Monitor options flow (call vs put volume, small vs large orders)
4. If mentions >5x AND call volume >3x AND price >2%:
   - Classify as retail FOMO
   - Enter SHORT position (fade the move)
   - Exit when mentions normalize or stop-loss

TRADING STRATEGY:
- Entry: After FOMO spike confirmed (late in session)
- Position size: $65,000
- Target: Revert 50% of the day's move
- Stop-loss: Move continues another +1.5%
- Time stop: 2 days

RISK PARAMETERS:
- Position size: $65,000
- Stop-loss: 1.5% ($975)
- Time limit: 2 days
- Maximum concurrent positions: 3

Remember: "The market is full of patterns. The question is not whether they
          exist, but whether we can find them, validate them, and profit from
          them before they disappear."

          Keep discovering. Keep validating. Keep adapting.
