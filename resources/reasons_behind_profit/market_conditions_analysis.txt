================================================================================

Not all market conditions are created equal. Some environments are highly
favorable for our strategies, while others are challenging. This document
provides a systematic framework for understanding which market conditions
drive profitability and how to adapt.

KEY QUESTIONS THIS DOCUMENT ANSWERS:
1. Which market regimes are most profitable for our strategies?
2. What early warning signals indicate regime changes?
3. How should we adjust position sizing based on market conditions?
4. Which strategies work best in which environments?
5. Can we predict favorable conditions before they occur?

CORE DIMENSIONS:
- Volatility regimes
- Liquidity conditions
- Trend/momentum characteristics
- Order flow dynamics
- Cross-market correlations
- Event-driven opportunities
