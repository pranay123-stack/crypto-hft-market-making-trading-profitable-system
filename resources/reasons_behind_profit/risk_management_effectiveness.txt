                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Risk management is not just about preventing losses—it's about optimizing
risk-taking to maximize risk-adjusted returns. This document provides a
framework for measuring how risk controls contribute to profitability.

KEY QUESTIONS THIS DOCUMENT ANSWERS:
1. How much loss has been prevented by risk controls?
2. Are we taking enough risk (or too much)?
3. Which risk controls have the highest P&L impact?
4. How does position sizing affect profitability?
5. Are our risk-adjusted returns optimal?

CORE PRINCIPLE:
"The goal is not zero risk—it's optimal risk for maximum risk-adjusted return."

Remember: Risk management is not about avoiding risk—it's about taking the
          right risks in the right amounts at the right times. Optimize for
          risk-adjusted returns, not just returns.
