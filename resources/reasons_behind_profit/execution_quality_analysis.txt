                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Execution quality is the bridge between strategy signals and realized profits.
Even the best trading strategy loses money with poor execution. This document
provides a comprehensive framework for measuring execution quality and its
direct impact on P&L.

KEY QUESTIONS THIS DOCUMENT ANSWERS:
1. How much P&L is gained or lost through execution quality?
2. What is our fill rate and how does it impact profitability?
3. Are we getting price improvement or suffering slippage?
4. Which execution algorithms and venues perform best?
5. How can we optimize order routing and placement?

CORE METRICS:
- Fill rate and partial fills
- Slippage and price improvement
- Implementation shortfall
- Adverse selection
- Transaction cost analysis (TCA)
- Queue position and timing
