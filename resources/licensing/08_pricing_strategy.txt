Win Rate by Tier:

CONCLUSION:

Our pricing strategy balances three objectives:
1. Maximize revenue and profit
2. Demonstrate clear value vs alternatives
3. Scale from small to large customers

advantage) while still delivering 30-70% cost savings vs alternatives.

Three-tier structure (Starter/Professional/Enterprise) covers full market from
small prop firms to major institutions, with clear upgrade path and expansion
revenue opportunities (seats, exchanges, services).

Result: $218M revenue by 2029, 78-90% gross margins, 60:1 LTV/CAC ratio.
