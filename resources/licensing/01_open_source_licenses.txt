OPEN SOURCE LICENSE ANALYSIS
Understanding MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL and Implications for HFT System
================================================================================

OUR DEPENDENCIES ON OPEN SOURCE:

The HFT system uses several open source components:
- C++ Standard Library (permissive)
- Boost Libraries (Boost License, permissive)
- RocksDB (Apache 2.0)
- Redis (BSD 3-Clause)  
- DPDK (BSD)
- Prometheus client (Apache 2.0)

All dependencies use permissive licenses - no GPL contamination.

KEY LICENSE TYPES:

MIT LICENSE:
- Most permissive
- Allows commercial use, modification, distribution
- Only requirement: Include copyright notice
- No copyleft provisions
- Examples: Many JavaScript libraries

APACHE 2.0:
- Permissive like MIT
- Includes explicit patent grant
- Requires NOTICE file with attributions
- Can combine with proprietary code
- Examples: RocksDB, Kubernetes, Android

GPL v3 (avoided):
- Copyleft: Derivative works must be GPL
- "Viral" license spreads to combined works
- Would prevent proprietary licensing
- We do NOT use any GPL dependencies
- Careful audit to ensure no GPL contamination

OUR APPROACH:
- Proprietary core (our competitive advantage)
- Use permissive open source where appropriate
- Contribute non-critical components back to community
- Maintain clear separation between proprietary and open source

COMPLIANCE PROCESS:
1. All dependencies scanned with license checker
2. Legal review of new dependencies
3. Annual audit of dependency licenses
4. Documentation of all open source usage
5. Compliance with attribution requirements
