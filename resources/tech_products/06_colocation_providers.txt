FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

For New HFT Firms:
  1. Start with Equinix NY4 or Digital Realty (established providers)
  2. Choose facility closest to primary exchanges
  3. Right-size: Don't over-provision initially
  4. Negotiate 1-year contract for flexibility
  5. Plan DR from day one (even if delayed)

For Growing Firms:
  1. Lock in multi-year contracts (3-5 years)
  2. Implement hot standby DR
  3. Consider multi-site for geographic diversity
  4. Invest in automation and monitoring
  5. Build strong vendor relationships

For Established Firms:
  1. Optimize costs through renegotiation
  2. Consolidate providers for volume discounts
  3. Evaluate new technologies (400G, FPGA, cloud)
  4. Implement capacity planning processes
  5. Focus on operational excellence

Key Takeaway:
Colocation selection is a critical strategic decision for HFT firms. The right
facility can provide competitive advantage through lower latency, while the
wrong choice can result in performance issues and excessive costs. Invest time
in thorough evaluation, negotiate aggressively, and maintain strong operational
practices to maximize ROI.
