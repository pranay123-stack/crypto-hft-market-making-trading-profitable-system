TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT GUIDE FOR HFT SYSTEMS
================================================================================

Complete guide for purchasing hardware, software, and services for high-frequency
trading operations. Includes negotiation tactics, vendor management, and best
practices.

================================================================================
PROCUREMENT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

**Why This Matters:**
- Technology spending: $2M-$15M+ per year for HFT firms
- Vendor relationships critical for support and pricing
- Negotiation can save 20-40% on list prices
- Proper procurement ensures continuity and reduces risk

**Key Principles:**
1. Multiple quotes (3+ vendors minimum)
2. Volume discounts and multi-year commitments
3. Service level agreements (SLAs) negotiated upfront
4. Exit clauses and portability
5. Total cost of ownership (TCO), not just purchase price

================================================================================
VENDOR NEGOTIATION TACTICS
================================================================================

**1. Timing Your Purchase**

Best Times to Buy:
- **End of quarter** (March, June, September, December)
  - Sales teams need to hit quotas
  - Expect 15-25% discounts beyond standard

- **End of year** (November-December)
  - Vendors clearing inventory
  - Budget-conscious buyers
  - Discounts up to 30-40%

- **New product launch**
  - Previous generation discounted 20-30%
  - Often still excellent for HFT workloads

Worst Times to Buy:
- **January-February**: New budgets, less urgency
- **Product shortages**: Supply chain issues reduce leverage

**2. Multi-Vendor Competition**

Strategy:
```
Step 1: Identify 3-5 qualified vendors
Step 2: Issue simultaneous RFPs to all
Step 3: Initial proposals due (30 days)
Step 4: Select top 2-3 for negotiations
Step 5: Play vendors against each other
Step 6: "Best and final offer" round
Step 7: Award contract to winner
```

Example Script:
```
"We have proposals from [Vendor A] and [Vendor B]. Your pricing is
higher by 15%. Can you match or beat their offer? We're ready to
sign today if the numbers work."
```

**3. Volume Discounts**

Typical Discount Tiers:
- 1-10 units: List price or 5-10% off
- 11-25 units: 15-20% off
- 26-50 units: 20-30% off
- 51-100 units: 30-40% off
- 100+ units: 40-50% off (custom negotiation)

Example:
```
Server list price: $15,000
- Buy 1: $15,000 (0% off)
- Buy 10: $12,750 each = $127,500 total (15% off)
- Buy 25: $10,500 each = $262,500 total (30% off)
- Buy 50: $9,000 each = $450,000 total (40% off)

Savings: $300,000 on 50 units (vs buying individually)
```

**4. Multi-Year Commitments**

Annual vs Multi-Year Pricing:
- 1-year: List price
- 3-year: 15-20% discount
- 5-year: 25-30% discount

Risks:
- Technology obsolescence (servers last 3-5 years typically)
- Vendor lock-in (harder to switch)
- Price decreases (market prices may drop)

Mitigations:
- Include upgrade clauses (can swap for newer models)
- Exit clauses (pay 50% remaining if terminating early)
- Price protection (if market price drops, renegotiate)

**5. Bundling Strategy**

Bundle Different Products:
```
Example Bundle Negotiation:
- 10 servers @ $15K = $150K
- 20 NICs @ $1.2K = $24K
- 2 switches @ $25K = $50K
- 5-year support = $30K
TOTAL: $254K

Bundled Discount Request: 25% = $190,500
Savings: $63,500
```

Cross-Vendor Bundling:
```
"We're buying servers from Dell and NICs from Mellanox. If you
(Dell) can provide competitive NICs, we'll give you the whole order.
Total value: $254K instead of $150K."
```

**6. SLA Negotiation**

Standard SLA:
- Uptime: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
- Response: 24 hours
- Resolution: 48 hours
- Credits: None

Negotiated SLA for HFT:
- Uptime: 99.99% (52 minutes downtime/year)
- Response: 1 hour for critical, 4 hours for high
- Resolution: 4 hours for critical, 24 hours for high
- Credits: 10% monthly fee per hour down beyond SLA

Negotiation Script:
```
"99.9% uptime is not acceptable for trading systems. We lose
$10,000 per hour of downtime. We need 99.99% with financial
penalties for breaches. What credits can you offer?"
```

**7. Payment Terms**

Standard Terms:
- Payment: Net 30 days
- Discount: None

Negotiated Terms:
- Payment: Net 60 or Net 90 days (improves cash flow)
- Early pay discount: 2% if paid within 10 days (2/10 Net 30)
- Quarterly payments: For subscriptions (better cash management)
- Delayed start: First payment due after 30 days of successful use

Large Purchase Negotiation:
```
Purchase: $500,000
Standard: Net 30 ($500K due in 30 days)
Negotiated: 20% down, balance Net 90
Result: $100K in 30 days, $400K in 120 days
Cash flow benefit: $400K free for 3 months
```

**8. Warranty & Support Upgrades**

Standard Warranty:
- Duration: 1 year
- Response: Next business day (NBD)
- Hours: 8AM-5PM, Monday-Friday
- Parts: Ship within 3 business days

Negotiate For:
- Duration: 3-5 years
- Response: Same day or 4-hour
- Hours: 24/7/365
- Parts: Advanced replacement (ship before defective returned)
- Cost: Often free or 10-20% of purchase price

Example:
```
Server: $15,000 (1-year warranty included)
5-year NBD: +$1,500 (10%)
5-year 4-hour: +$3,000 (20%)

Negotiated: 5-year NBD included free (saves $1,500 per server)
```

```

**Vendor Tier System:**

**Tier 1 (Strategic Partners):**
- Score: 8.5-10
- Annual spend: >$250K
- Quarterly reviews
- Executive-level relationships
- Joint roadmap planning

**Tier 2 (Preferred Vendors):**
- Score: 7.0-8.4
- Annual spend: $50K-$250K
- Semi-annual reviews
- Stable relationships
- Standard terms

**Tier 3 (Approved Vendors):**
- Score: 5.5-6.9

**Tier 4 (Probation/Exit):**
- Score: <5.5
- Action: Find replacement or demand improvement
- 90-day review
- Escalate to vendor executive team

**Vendor Risk Management:**

Single-Vendor Dependencies:
- Risk: Vendor failure, price increase, service issues
- Mitigation: Multi-vendor strategy where possible

Example:
```
Market Data:
- Primary: Bloomberg (80% of feeds)
- Secondary: Refinitiv (15% of feeds)
- Tertiary: IEX Cloud (5% of feeds)

Result: Can survive if any single vendor fails
```

**Contract Management:**

Key Dates to Track:
- Renewal date (set reminder 90 days prior)
- Price increase dates
- Auto-renewal opt-out deadlines
- Support expiration dates
- License audit windows

Contract Repository:
- Central location (shared drive, contract management software)
- Metadata: Vendor, value, dates, owner
- Alerts: 90, 60, 30 days before expiration

================================================================================
COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
================================================================================

**1. Standardization**
- Reduce SKU count (easier to manage, better volume pricing)
- Standard server configs (easier to support, spare parts)
- Standard software stack (lower training costs)

Example:
```
Before: 5 different server models, 10 different NIC models
After: 2 standard server configs, 2 NIC models
Savings: 15% on hardware, 30% on support costs
```

**2. Open Source Where Possible**
- OS: Linux (free) vs Windows Server ($6,000)
- Database: PostgreSQL (free) vs Oracle ($47,500/core)
- Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana (free) vs Datadog ($20K/year)

Savings: $100K-$500K/year for medium firm

**3. Right-Sizing**
- Don't over-provision (pay for what you need)
- Cloud: Use spot instances for non-critical workloads (90% savings)
- Storage: Tiered storage (hot SSD, warm HDD, cold S3)

**4. Commitment Discounts**
- 1-year: No discount
- 3-year: 15-20% discount
- 5-year: 25-30% discount

Risk: Overpaying if not utilizing fully

**5. Vendor Consolidation**
- Fewer vendors = higher spend per vendor = better discounts
- But: Risk of single-vendor dependency

Sweet Spot: 3-5 strategic vendors (Tier 1)

**6. Timing Purchases**
- End of quarter/year (as noted earlier)
- Batch purchases (volume discounts)

**7. Negotiate Everything**
- Even "non-negotiable" pricing can often be negotiated
- Ask for: Volume discounts, multi-year discounts, payment terms
- "What's the best you can do?"

================================================================================
COMMON PITFALLS & HOW TO AVOID
================================================================================

**Pitfall 1: Vendor Lock-In**
- Issue: Proprietary formats, no data portability
- Avoid: Use open standards (FIX, JSON, etc.)
- Negotiate: Exit assistance in contracts

**Pitfall 2: Hidden Costs**
- Issue: Support, maintenance, training not included
- Avoid: Ask for "all-in" pricing, TCO analysis
- Example: Software $50K, support $15K/year (not disclosed upfront)

**Pitfall 3: Overbuying**
- Issue: Purchased for future need, never used
- Avoid: Buy for current need + 20% growth buffer
- Example: Bought 50 servers, only using 35 (30% waste)

**Pitfall 4: Auto-Renewals**
- Issue: Contract auto-renews at higher price
- Avoid: Calendar reminders 90 days before renewal
- Action: Opt-out or renegotiate

**Pitfall 5: Inadequate SLAs**
- Issue: Vendor not held accountable for downtime
- Avoid: Negotiate financial penalties for SLA breaches
- Example: 99.9% SLA with no credits = vendor doesn't care

**Pitfall 6: Poor Vendor Relationship**
- Issue: No account manager, slow support
- Avoid: Spend enough to matter ($100K+ annual)
- Action: Escalate to vendor executive if needed

**Pitfall 7: Not Comparing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
- Issue: Cheapest option has high support costs
- Avoid: Calculate 3-year TCO, not just purchase price
- Example: Server A: $10K + $5K/yr support = $25K TCO
           Server B: $15K + $2K/yr support = $21K TCO (better!)
