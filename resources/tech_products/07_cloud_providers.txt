1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Cloud computing plays an increasingly important role in HFT infrastructure,
though with specific constraints. While ultra-low-latency trading must remain
in colocation facilities adjacent to exchanges, cloud platforms excel at:

Primary HFT Cloud Use Cases:
- Historical data storage and analytics (petabyte-scale)
- Backtesting and strategy simulation (elastic compute)
- Machine learning model training (GPU/TPU clusters)
- Risk analytics and compliance reporting
- Disaster recovery and business continuity
- Development and testing environments
- Market data processing and normalization

Why Cloud Cannot Replace Colocation for Trading:
- Latency: Cloud 5-20ms vs. Colo 0.1-0.5ms to exchanges
- Jitter: Cloud unpredictable vs. Colo consistent
- Network: Shared vs. Dedicated paths to exchanges
- Control: Limited vs. Full hardware/network control
- Cost: High for sustained workloads vs. Predictable colo

Optimal Architecture: Hybrid Model
- Trading systems: Colocation (Equinix, Digital Realty)
- Analytics/ML: Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Interconnect: Private links (Direct Connect, Interconnect, ExpressRoute)
- Data sync: Real-time for critical, batch for historical

================================================================================
2. AWS (AMAZON WEB SERVICES)

8.2 COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compute Optimization:

Reserved Instances / Commitments:
  Savings: 30-60% for 1-3 year commitments
  Best For: Predictable, sustained workloads
  Strategy: Commit for baseline, use on-demand for spikes

Spot / Preemptible Instances:
  Savings: 60-90% off on-demand
  Risk: Can be interrupted
  Best For: Fault-tolerant backtesting, batch analytics
  Strategy: Use for non-critical, stateless workloads

Right-Sizing:
  Method: Monitor utilization, downsize underutilized instances
  Savings: 20-40% typical
  Tools: AWS Compute Optimizer, GCP Recommender, Azure Advisor

Autoscaling:
  Method: Scale compute up/down based on demand
  Savings: 30-50% for variable workloads
  Best For: Backtesting, dev/test environments

Storage Optimization:

Lifecycle Policies:
  Method: Auto-tier data to cheaper storage (Hot → Cool → Archive)
  Savings: 50-90% on older data
  Strategy: Age out data based on access patterns

Data Compression:
  Method: Compress data before storage
  Savings: 50-80% storage costs
  Tools: Gzip, Snappy, Parquet columnar format

Deduplication:
  Method: Remove duplicate data
  Savings: 20-50% depending on data
  Strategy: Especially effective for tick data with repeating patterns

Networking Optimization:

Equity Desk (50% of compute, 30% of storage):
  Compute: $10,000/month
  Storage: $3,000/month
  Total: $13,000/month

Futures Desk (30% of compute, 20% of storage):
  Compute: $6,000/month
  Storage: $2,000/month
  Total: $8,000/month

Research (20% of compute, 50% of storage):
  Compute: $4,000/month
  Storage: $5,000/month
  Total: $9,000/month

10.6 MONITORING AND ALERTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Metrics to Monitor:

Compute:
  - CPU utilization (alert if >80% sustained)
  - Memory utilization (alert if >85%)
  - Network throughput (alert if approaching limits)
  - Instance health checks

Storage:
  - IOPS utilization (alert if >80% provisioned)
  - Disk space (alert if >80% full)
  - Backup success/failure
  - Latency (alert if >5ms for critical volumes)

Cost:
  - Daily spend (alert if >110% of budget)
  - Unusual spending patterns
  - Unutilized resources (idle instances)

Alerting Channels:
  - PagerDuty / OpsGenie for critical
  - Email for high priority
  - Slack for medium priority
  - Dashboard for informational

10.7 FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For New HFT Firms:
  1. Start with AWS (most mature, best documentation)
  2. Use hybrid model from day one (trading in colo, analytics in cloud)
  3. Implement cost monitoring immediately
  4. Leverage Reserved Instances for predictable savings
  5. Build DR into initial architecture

For Existing Firms Migrating to Cloud:
  1. Migrate non-latency-critical workloads first
  2. Use private connectivity (Direct Connect, etc.)
  3. Implement comprehensive testing before production cutover
  4. Train team on cloud-native architectures
  5. Continuously optimize costs

For Multi-Strategy Firms:
  1. Use multi-cloud for best-of-breed services
  2. AWS for sustained compute and breadth of services
  3. GCP for ML/AI and big data analytics
  4. Implement robust cost allocation (tagging)
  5. Centralized security and compliance

Key Takeaway:
Cloud is a critical component of modern HFT infrastructure, but not a replacement
for colocation. The optimal architecture leverages both: colo for ultra-low-
latency trading and cloud for scalable analytics, ML, and storage. Choose the
cloud provider based on your specific workload requirements and optimize
relentlessly for cost and performance.
