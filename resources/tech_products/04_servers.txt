1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Server selection is foundational to HFT infrastructure performance. The right
platform balances CPU performance, memory bandwidth, PCIe connectivity, and
power efficiency while meeting strict latency requirements.

Critical Selection Factors for HFT:
- CPU: Latest generation Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC processors
- Memory: DDR5-4800 or faster, ECC required, minimum 256GB
- PCIe: Gen 4.0/5.0 support with sufficient lanes for NICs and FPGAs
- Storage: NVMe for low-latency data access
- Power: Redundant PSUs with 80+ Titanium efficiency

================================================================================
12. PROCUREMENT STRATEGY
================================================================================

PURCHASING APPROACHES
----------------------
1. Direct from Manufacturer:
   Advantages:
   - Access to latest configurations
   - Direct technical support relationship
   - Volume discounts on 10+ units
   - Custom configuration options

   Disadvantages:
   - Longer lead times (3-6 weeks)
   - Higher minimum order quantities
   - Less flexibility on payment terms

2. Authorized Resellers (CDW, Insight, SHI):
   Advantages:
   - Faster delivery (some stock on hand)
   - NET30 payment terms available
   - Relationship pricing for repeat customers
   - One-stop shopping for multiple brands

   Disadvantages:
   - 5-10% markup vs. direct
   - Limited custom configurations
   - Support goes through reseller first

3. Grey Market / Refurbished:
   Advantages:
   - 30-50% cost savings
   - Immediate availability

   Disadvantages:
   - Limited or no warranty
   - Unknown component history
   - Not recommended for production HFT systems

VOLUME DISCOUNTS
-----------------
Typical discount tiers (Dell example):

- 1-4 servers: List price
- 5-9 servers: 8% discount
- 10-19 servers: 15% discount
- 20-49 servers: 22% discount
- 50+ servers: 30%+ discount (negotiable)

Example: 10x Dell R750 (HFT config at $15,200 each)
- List price: $152,000
- 15% discount: $129,200
- Savings: $22,800

RFP (REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL) STRATEGY
------------------------------------
For deployments of 10+ servers:

1. Prepare RFP Document:
   - Exact specifications required
   - Delivery timeline
   - Support requirements
   - Payment terms
   - Total 3-year TCO

2. Send to Multiple Vendors:
   - Dell
   - HPE
   - Supermicro (via integrator)
   - Lenovo

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - Price (40%)
   - Lead time (20%)
   - Support quality (20%)
   - Vendor relationship (10%)
   - Financing options (10%)

4. Negotiation Points:
   - Volume discounts
   - Extended payment terms (NET60/NET90)
   - Free extended warranty
   - Free advanced replacement
   - On-site technical support for deployment

FINANCING OPTIONS
------------------
1. Dell Financial Services (DFS):
   - 3-year leases available
   - Fair Market Value (FMV) lease: Lower monthly payments
   - $1 Buyout: Fixed end-of-lease cost
   - Operating lease: Off-balance sheet treatment

   Example: $150,000 server purchase
   - 36-month FMV lease: $4,800/month
   - Total cost: $172,800 (15% premium)

2. HP Financial Services:
   - Similar structure to DFS
   - Technology refresh programs
   - Flexible end-of-term options

3. Third-Party Leasing:
   - GreatAmerica Financial Services
   - CIT Group
   - Typically 1-2% higher rates than OEM

BUDGET PLANNING
----------------
Sample HFT Infrastructure Budget (10-server deployment):

Trading Servers (4x Dell R750 - HFT config):
  Hardware: $60,800 (4 x $15,200)
  Support: $5,800/year (ProSupport Plus)

Market Data Servers (4x HPE DL380 G11):
  Hardware: $59,200 (4 x $14,800)
  Support: $4,800/year (Datacenter Care)

Development Servers (2x Supermicro SYS-2029U):
  Hardware: $23,000 (2 x $11,500)
  Support: $1,600/year (Gold support)

Network Equipment:
  Switches: $80,000 (see 05_switches.txt)
  NICs (additional): $12,000
  Cables/Transceivers: $8,000

Subtotal Hardware: $243,000

Recurring Costs (Annual):
  Support contracts: $12,200/year
  Colocation fees: $24,000/year (see 06_colocation_providers.txt)
  Power and cooling: $6,000/year

Total First Year: $285,200
Recurring Annual: $42,200

3-Year TCO: $369,600

VENDOR EVALUATION CHECKLIST
----------------------------
Before committing to vendor:

Technical:
[ ] Verify server meets all technical requirements
[ ] Confirm PCIe slot configuration supports all NICs
[ ] Validate memory configuration (all channels populated)
[ ] Check NVMe drive compatibility
[ ] Verify BIOS supports required settings

Commercial:
[ ] Compare quotes from 3+ vendors
[ ] Verify lead time meets project timeline
[ ] Confirm support SLA (4-hour onsite recommended)
[ ] Check payment terms (NET30 minimum)
[ ] Negotiate volume discounts (10+ servers)

Operational:
[ ] Verify vendor has local support presence
[ ] Check vendor financial stability (Dun & Bradstreet)
[ ] Review vendor's HFT customer references
[ ] Confirm spare parts availability
[ ] Verify firmware update policy

PROCUREMENT TIMELINE
--------------------
Typical timeline for 10-server deployment:

Week 1-2: Requirements gathering and RFP preparation
Week 3-4: RFP distribution and vendor responses
Week 5: Vendor evaluation and selection
Week 6: Purchase order issuance
Week 7-10: Manufacturing and delivery (3-4 weeks lead time)
Week 11: Receiving, inspection, and inventory
Week 12-13: Installation and configuration
Week 14: Burn-in testing
Week 15: Production deployment

Total: 15 weeks (3.5 months)

Critical Path Items:
- Custom configurations (add 1-2 weeks)
- International shipping (add 2-3 weeks)
- Exchange cross-connect installation (add 2-4 weeks)

SPARE PARTS STRATEGY
--------------------
Recommended spares for 10-server deployment:

Critical Spares (keep on-site):
- 2x Power supplies (most common failure): $500 each
- 4x DIMMs (memory failures): $300 each
- 2x NVMe drives (boot drives): $200 each
- 1x Network card (backup for trading server): $2,500

Total Spares Investment: $5,100

Non-Critical (vendor advanced replacement):
- Motherboard
- CPUs
- Fans
- RAID controllers

Justification:
- 4-hour vendor onsite may miss trading hours
- Critical failures need immediate resolution
- Spares pay for themselves after one avoided outage
