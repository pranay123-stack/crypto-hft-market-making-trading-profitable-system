KEYS TO SUCCESS & COMMON PITFALLS
================================================================================

Keys to Success: 1. Team Quality: Hire A+ talent, pay well, retain through 
equity and culture. Best teams from Jump, Citadel, Jane Street. 2. Technology 
Excellence: Invest in best-in-class infrastructure. Sub-millisecond latency 
mandatory. Buy (QuantFlow) vs build (18 month delay). 3. Risk Management: 
Independent risk function. Conservative limits initially. Culture of risk 
awareness. 4. Focus: Don't try to do everything. Master 2-3 strategies deeply. 
Add more once profitable. 5. Discipline: Stick to process. Don't revenge trade. 
Follow risk limits religiously. 6. Capitalization: Raise enough capital (2-3x 
what you think you need). Don't run out of runway before profitability. 7. 
Relationships: Cultivate exchange relationships. Network with other market 
makers. Learn from industry veterans. 8. Continuous Improvement: Always 
optimizing (latency, strategies, operations). Research 20-30% of resources. 
Stay ahead of competition. 9. Adaptability: Markets change, strategies decay. 
Need to evolve constantly. Rapid iteration capability. 10. Long-term Mindset: 
Takes 18-24 months to build great desk. Don't expect overnight success. Play 
long game. Common Pitfalls: 1. Undercapitalization: Running out of money before 
profitable. Mitigation: Raise 2-3x planned amount. 2. Over-leveraging: Taking 
excessive risk to make up for losses. Mitigation: Stick to risk limits, circuit 
breakers. 3. Technology Shortcuts: Cheaping out on infrastructure. Mitigation: 
Invest properly, use proven platforms. 4. Weak Team: Hiring B/C players to save 
money. Mitigation: Pay up for A players, they're worth it. 5. Ignoring Risk: 
Underestimating crypto volatility and operational risks. Mitigation: 
Independent risk management, conservative limits. 6. Strategy Decay: Not 
noticing when strategies stop working. Mitigation: Continuous monitoring, rapid 
iteration. 7. Lack of Focus: Trying too many strategies at once. Mitigation: 
Focus on 2-3 core competencies. 8. Poor Execution: Ideas are easy, execution is 
hard. Mitigation: Hire operators, not just thinkers. Bias to action. 9. 
Regulatory Surprises: Unexpected regulatory changes. Mitigation: Proactive 
compliance, flexible architecture. 10. Giving Up Too Early: Quitting before 
reaching profitability. Mitigation: Adequate runway, milestone-based approach. 
Success Metrics (12 months): Technology: <1ms latency, 99.95%+ uptime, 10+ 
exchanges integrated. Trading: $500M+ monthly volume, Sharpe >1.5, <15% max 
drawdown. Team: 10-12 people hired, <10% turnover, high engagement. Financial: 
On track for profitability Month 18-24, Burn rate under control, Capital 
adequately deployed. Red Flags: High turnover (>25%/year), Consistent losses 
(>3 months), Regulatory issues, Technology outages, Difficulty raising capital. 
If you see multiple red flags: Pivot or shut down. Don't throw good money after 
bad.
