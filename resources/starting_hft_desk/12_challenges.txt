TOP 15 CHALLENGES
================================================================================

1. Talent Acquisition: Challenge: Hard to find engineers with HFT + crypto 
experience. Mitigation: Hire from TradFi HFT, train on crypto. Competitive 
compensation. 2. Technology Complexity: Challenge: Building low-latency systems 
is hard. Mitigation: Buy proven platform (QuantFlow), focus on strategies not 
infrastructure. 3. Regulatory Uncertainty: Challenge: Crypto regulations 
evolving. Mitigation: Proactive compliance, flexible architecture, legal 
counsel. 4. Exchange Reliability: Challenge: Crypto exchanges have outages. 
Mitigation: Diversify across exchanges, build resilient systems, maintain 
buffer. 5. Market Volatility: Challenge: Crypto 10x more volatile than 
equities. Mitigation: Conservative risk limits, dynamic position sizing, 
circuit breakers. 6. Competition: Challenge: Increasing competition from TradFi 
HFT firms entering crypto. Mitigation: Technology edge, specialization, 
relationships. 7. Capital Requirements: Challenge: Need $2-5M initial + $10-50M 
trading capital. Mitigation: Start smaller ($5M total), prove model, raise 
more. 8. Operational Risk: Challenge: Fat finger trades, system bugs, human 
error. Mitigation: Rigorous testing, pre-trade controls, independent risk team. 
9. Key Person Risk: Challenge: Dependent on few key people. Mitigation: 
Document everything, cross-train, retention packages. 10. Profitability 
Timeline: Challenge: 12-18 months to profitability (long runway). Mitigation: 
Adequate capital, manage burn rate, milestone-based approach. 11. Exchange 
Fees: Challenge: Trading fees eat into profits (especially for HFT). 
Mitigation: Negotiate market maker rebates, volume discounts, optimize 
maker/taker ratio. 12. Latency Arms Race: Challenge: Competitors getting 
faster. Mitigation: Continuous optimization, FPGA if needed, focus on alpha not 
just speed. 13. Strategy Development: Challenge: Finding profitable strategies 
is hard. Mitigation: Hire experienced quants, research team, backtest 
rigorously. 14. Scaling Challenges: Challenge: Strategies that work at $5M 
don't work at $50M. Mitigation: Diversify strategies, add new markets, manage 
capacity. 15. Exit Difficulty: Challenge: Hard to sell prop trading desk. 
Mitigation: Build sellable business (IP, systems, team), court buyers early.
