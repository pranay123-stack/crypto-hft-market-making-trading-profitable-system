EXIT OPTIONS AND TIMELINE
================================================================================

Exit Scenarios: 1. Sell to Bank/Institution (40% probability): Timeline: Year 
4-7. Buyers: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, DRW, Citadel, etc. Valuation: 3-8x annual 
profit (e.g., $15M profit → $45M-$120M sale). Structure: Cash + earnout, 
Employment agreements for key people. Trigger: Consistent profitability (3+ 
years), $10M+ annual profit, Strong team and IP. 2. Merge with Another Desk 
(25% probability): Timeline: Year 3-5. Partners: Similar-sized HFT desk or 
complementary strategy. Rationale: Scale, diversification, talent combination. 
Structure: Equity swap, shared governance. Outcome: Larger, more stable 
combined entity. 3. Independent/Bootstrap (20% probability): Timeline: Ongoing. 
Strategy: Remain independent, return profits to partners. Distributions: 50-70% 
of annual profit paid out. Growth: Organic, reinvest 30-50% of profit. Suitable 
if: Don't want outside capital, Prefer control, Team wants long-term income 
stream. 4. Acqui-hire by Tech Company (10% probability): Timeline: Year 2-4 (if 
struggling). Buyers: Trading platform (like QuantFlow), Exchange, Fintech. 
Valuation: $3M-$10M (mostly for team). When: Struggling financially but strong 
team/tech. Better than shutting down. 5. Shut Down (<5% probability): Timeline: 
Year 1-3 if failing. Reasons: Can't achieve profitability, Key person leaves, 
Capital runs out, Regulatory issues. Outcome: Return remaining capital to 
investors, Salvage technology/IP. Minimize this risk through proper planning. 
Optimizing Exit Value: Build Sellable Assets: Documented trading strategies, 
Proprietary technology/IP, Strong team with retention, Customer relationships 
(if applicable), Regulatory licenses. Financial Performance: 3+ years of 
profitability, Growing profit trajectory, Sharpe ratio 2.5+, Low drawdowns. 
Operational Excellence: Clean books and records, Strong compliance, 
Institutional-grade infrastructure, Low key-person risk (documented processes). 
Timing: Sell during crypto bull market (higher valuations), After strong 
performance year, When multiple buyers interested (create competition). 
Valuation Multiples: Typical: 3-6x annual profit for prop desk, Premium 
(6-10x): If unique IP, Strong team, Scalable infrastructure. Example: Year 5 
profit: $12M. Valuation at 5x: $60M. Founders own 80% (20% to 
employees/investors): $48M. Assuming 3 founders: $16M each. Life-changing 
outcome. Preparation Timeline: Year 4: Identify potential buyers, Build 
relationships, Clean up operations, Document everything. Year 5: Engage 
investment banker (or DIY), Approach buyers, Negotiate LOI, Due diligence (3-6 
months), Close transaction. Post-Exit: Employment agreements: 2-3 years 
typically, Earnouts: Additional payment based on future performance, 
Non-compete: 1-2 years, Role transition: Founders may stay or leave after 
earnout period. Alternative: IPO (unlikely for small prop desk, but possible if 
built into multi-desk fund management company). Portfolio Strategy: Some 
founders: Start desk, sell after 5 years, start another (serial entrepreneurs). 
Others: Build long-term independent business (lifestyle business). Best fit 
depends on: Personal goals, Team preferences, Market opportunities. 
Recommendation: Plan for exit from day 1, but don't optimize for it (build 
great business, exit will follow).
