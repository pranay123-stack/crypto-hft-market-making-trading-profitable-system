1.5-2.5, ROI on trading capital: 10-30%. Year 3+ (mature): +$5M to +$15M 
profit, Sharpe ratio: 2.0-4.0, ROI: 20-60%. Revenue Breakdown: Spread capture

fees: -$450K (1.5% of capital). Net trading P&L: $14.55M. Operating expenses: 
-$3M (technology $500K, personnel $2M, other $500K). Net profit: $11.55M (38.5% 
ROI on trading capital). Sharpe Ratio: Definition: (Return - Risk-free rate) / 
Standard deviation. Target: 2.0-4.0 (excellent for any strategy). Comparison:

Drawdowns: Typical: 5-15% (from peak). Maximum tolerable: 20-25%. Recovery

absolute returns. $10M at 3.0 Sharpe > $20M at 1.0 Sharpe (risk-adjusted). 
Benchmarks: Aim to beat crypto index (Bitcoin) on risk-adjusted basis. 
Outperform 80%+ of crypto hedge funds. Scaling: $10M capital → $20-30M profit 
potential (2.0-3.0 return). $30M capital → $40-60M profit potential (1.3-2.0 
return, diminishing). $100M capital → $80-120M profit potential (0.8-1.2 
return, harder to deploy).
