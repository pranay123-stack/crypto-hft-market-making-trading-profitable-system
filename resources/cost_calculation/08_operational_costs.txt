COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------

1. NEGOTIATE POWER RATES
   - Multi-year contracts with colocation providers
   - Volume discounts
   - Potential savings: 10-15% on power costs

2. OPTIMIZE POWER USAGE EFFECTIVENESS (PUE)
   - Choose colocation providers with low PUE (<1.3)
   - Consolidate servers to reduce total power
   - Savings: $10,000 - $20,000 annually

3. REDUCE BANDWIDTH OVERPROVISIONING
   - Right-size bandwidth based on actual usage
   - Burst capabilities instead of always-on high bandwidth
   - Savings: $30,000 - $60,000 annually

4. PREVENTIVE > REACTIVE
   - Invest in preventive maintenance
   - Reduce emergency repairs and downtime
   - Long-term savings: $20,000 - $40,000 annually

5. REMOTE HANDS OPTIMIZATION
   - Develop remote management capabilities
   - Reduce need for physical site visits
   - Savings: $50,000 - $80,000 annually in travel

6. SHARED OFFICE SPACE
   - Coworking space instead of dedicated office
   - Reduce by 50-70%
   - Savings: $100,000 - $300,000 over 3 years

7. AUTOMATION
   - Automated monitoring reduces 24/7 support costs
   - Self-healing systems reduce incident response
   - Savings: $40,000 - $80,000 annually

MINIMUM OPERATIONAL BUDGET

MAXIMUM OPERATIONAL BUDGET
---------------------------

Full-Scale Operation:
- Year 1: $870,000
- Year 2: $830,000
- Year 3: $830,000
- 3-Year Total: $2,530,000

RECOMMENDED BUDGET
------------------

Balanced Approach:

- Year 2: $600,000
- Year 3: $600,000
- 3-Year Total: $1,850,000

This provides robust operational support while
controlling costs through efficiency and optimization.
