================================================================================

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------

1. OPEN SOURCE FIRST APPROACH
   Replace commercial licenses with open source:
   - PostgreSQL instead of enterprise databases
   - Prometheus + Grafana instead of Datadog
   - Ubuntu instead of RHEL
   - Community support instead of enterprise

   Potential Savings: $1,200,000 - $1,600,000 (58-59%)
   Reduced 3-Year Cost: $800,000 - $1,100,000

2. SELF-HOSTED VS SAAS
   Host databases and monitoring internally:
   - Avoid per-node/per-GB SaaS pricing
   - Increases infrastructure costs
   - Requires more DevOps resources

   Potential Savings: $400,000 - $600,000

3. VOLUME LICENSING
   Negotiate enterprise agreements:
   - Multi-year commitments
   - Volume discounts (10-30%)

   Potential Savings: $200,000 - $400,000

4. ACADEMIC/STARTUP PROGRAMS
   If applicable:
   - GitHub Student/Startup programs
   - AWS/GCP credits (separate cloud costs)
   - Microsoft for Startups

   Potential Savings Year 1: $50,000 - $100,000

5. CONSOLIDATE VENDORS
   Reduce number of vendors:
   - Fewer contracts to manage
   - Volume discounts
   - Simplified billing

   Potential Savings: $100,000 - $200,000

RECOMMENDED BUDGET APPROACH
----------------------------

MINIMUM VIABLE (Open Source Heavy):
Year 1: $150,000 - $250,000
Year 2: $120,000 - $200,000
Year 3: $130,000 - $220,000
3-Year Total: $400,000 - $670,000

BALANCED (Mix of OSS and Commercial):
Year 1: $350,000 - $500,000
Year 2: $300,000 - $450,000
Year 3: $320,000 - $470,000
3-Year Total: $970,000 - $1,420,000

ENTERPRISE GRADE (Full Commercial Stack):
Year 1: $700,000 - $950,000
Year 2: $650,000 - $900,000
Year 3: $680,000 - $940,000
3-Year Total: $2,030,000 - $2,790,000

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
For HFT systems, suggest BALANCED approach:
- Use open source for non-critical components
- Commercial licenses for mission-critical (databases, monitoring)
- Enterprise support for production systems
- Community support for development environments

Estimated 3-Year Cost: $970,000 - $1,420,000

This provides enterprise-grade reliability while controlling costs.
