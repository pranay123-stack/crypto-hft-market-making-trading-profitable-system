AVERAGE ANNUAL COST: $8,784,400 - $11,513,400

Note: These costs can become REVENUE with successful market making strategies
that earn more in maker rebates than paid in taker fees.

================================================================================

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------

1. QUALIFY FOR MARKET MAKER STATUS
   - Earn rebates instead of paying fees
   - Can turn net $20M annual cost into $10M annual revenue
   - Requirements: Quote spreads, volume thresholds

2. VOLUME TIER OPTIMIZATION
   - Concentrate volume on fewer exchanges initially
   - Qualify for highest tiers (lowest fees/highest rebates)
   - Savings: 20-40% on trading fees

3. EXCHANGE SELECTION
   - Start with 3-5 most liquid exchanges
   - Add exchanges as volume grows
   - Year 1 Savings: $3M - $5M

4. NEGOTIATED RATES
   - Direct negotiations with exchanges
   - Custom fee schedules for high volume
   - Potential: 10-30% reduction

5. MEMBER DISCOUNTS
   - CME membership: 30-50% fee reduction
   - NYSE member firm status
   - Upfront cost, long-term savings

6. SPONSORED ACCESS vs DIRECT
   - Sponsored access through broker: Lower setup cost
   - Direct membership: Lower ongoing fees
   - Choose based on volume projections

7. MARKET DATA OPTIMIZATION
   - Consolidate data vendors
   - Use exchange-provided data where possible
   - Avoid Bloomberg/Refinitiv unless necessary
   - Savings: $200K - $400K annually

PHASED ROLLOUT APPROACH
------------------------

YEAR 1 - START SMALL (3-5 Exchanges)
- NYSE, NASDAQ, BZX (US Equities)
- CME (Futures)
- Total Year 1: $4M - $6M

YEAR 2 - EXPAND (7-10 Exchanges)
- Add: IEX, CBOE Options
- Add: LSE, Euronext
- Total Year 2: $6M - $9M

YEAR 3 - FULL DEPLOYMENT (10+ Exchanges)
- Add: TSE, HKEX
- Add: Crypto (if applicable)
- Total Year 3: $8M - $11M

This phased approach reduces initial capital requirements while allowing
strategy validation before full expansion.
