================================================================================

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------

1. PHASED DEPLOYMENT
   - Start with 2-3 key markets (NY, Chicago)
   - Expand to London/Tokyo in Year 2
   - Savings Year 1: $500,000 - $800,000

2. USED/REFURBISHED EQUIPMENT
   - High-quality refurbished servers
   - Savings: 30-40% on server costs
   - Year 1 Savings: $300,000 - $550,000

3. LEASING vs BUYING
   - Lease colocation racks
   - Lease networking equipment
   - Reduce upfront capital: 50-60%
   - Higher ongoing costs, lower initial

4. CONSOLIDATION
   - Fewer, more powerful servers
   - Reduce rack space requirements
   - Savings: $200,000 - $400,000 over 3 years

5. CLOUD HYBRID (Limited)
   - Use cloud for dev/test/backup
   - Keep production on-premise
   - Savings: $100,000 - $200,000

6. NEGOTIATE COLOCATION CONTRACTS
   - Multi-year agreements
   - Volume discounts
   - Savings: 10-20% on colo costs

7. SOFTWARE-BASED SOLUTIONS
   - Use software NICs where latency permits
   - Skip FPGA unless absolutely necessary
   - Savings: $500,000 - $1,000,000

INFRASTRUCTURE SCALABILITY
---------------------------

SMALL OPERATION (3-5 Exchanges):
- 2 colocation sites
- 25-30 servers
- 3-Year Cost: $2,500,000 - $3,800,000

MEDIUM OPERATION (5-10 Exchanges):
- 3-4 colocation sites
- 50-60 servers
- 3-Year Cost: $5,800,000 - $9,200,000 (this estimate)

LARGE OPERATION (10+ Exchanges):
- 5+ colocation sites
- 100+ servers
- 3-Year Cost: $12,000,000 - $18,000,000
