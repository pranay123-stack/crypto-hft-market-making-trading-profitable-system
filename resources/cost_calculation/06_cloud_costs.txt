                    CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS - HFT SYSTEM
                  AWS/GCP/Azure Costs for Hybrid Deployment
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Cloud costs represent 3-4% of total 3-year TCO ($250K - $450K).
HFT systems typically use cloud for:
- Development/testing environments
- Disaster recovery and backup
- Analytics and machine learning workloads
- Historical data processing
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

IMPORTANT: Production trading systems remain on-premise in colocation
facilities for latency reasons. Cloud is used for non-latency-critical workloads.

================================================================================

CLOUD STRATEGY FOR HFT
-----------------------

PRIMARY USE CASES:
1. Development & Testing (50-60% of cloud spend)
2. Disaster Recovery & Backup (20-25%)
3. Analytics & ML (15-20%)
4. Monitoring & Logging (5-10%)

PROVIDERS COMPARISON:
- AWS: Most comprehensive, highest cost
- GCP: Better for ML/analytics, competitive pricing
- Azure: Good for hybrid scenarios, Microsoft tools

Recommendation: Multi-cloud strategy
- Primary: AWS (broadest services)
- Secondary: GCP (ML workloads, cost optimization)

================================================================================

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES
-----------------------------

1. RESERVED INSTANCES / COMMITTED USE DISCOUNTS
   - 1-year reservations: 30-40% savings
   - 3-year reservations: 50-60% savings
   - Estimated savings: $50,000 - $80,000 annually

2. SPOT INSTANCES FOR BATCH WORKLOADS
   - EMR/Dataproc clusters: 70-90% cheaper
   - Non-critical workloads only
   - Estimated savings: $30,000 - $50,000 annually

3. RIGHTSIZE INSTANCES
   - Use AWS Compute Optimizer
   - Downsize over-provisioned instances
   - Savings: 20-30% on compute

4. LIFECYCLE POLICIES FOR STORAGE
   - Auto-transition to cheaper storage tiers
   - S3 Intelligent-Tiering
   - Savings: $20,000 - $40,000 annually

5. USE CLOUD-NATIVE ALTERNATIVES
   - Replace third-party tools with cloud services
   - Example: CloudWatch instead of Datadog (for dev)
   - Savings: Variable, depends on tools

6. CROSS-REGION OPTIMIZATION
   - Minimize cross-region traffic
   - Use VPC peering instead of internet
   - Savings: $5,000 - $10,000 annually

7. AUTO-SCALING & SCHEDULING
   - Shut down dev/test during off-hours
   - Use Lambda for intermittent workloads
   - Savings: 40-60% on dev/test compute

MINIMUM CLOUD BUDGET
---------------------

Essential Services Only:
- Dev/Test (minimal): $20,000/year
- Backup/DR: $15,000/year
- Analytics (limited): $10,000/year

3-Year Minimum: $135,000

MAXIMUM CLOUD BUDGET
--------------------

Comprehensive Cloud Usage:
- Full dev/test environments: $60,000/year
- Robust DR: $40,000/year
- Extensive analytics: $80,000/year
- Full monitoring: $10,000/year

3-Year Maximum: $570,000

RECOMMENDED BUDGET
------------------

Balanced approach for HFT:
- Year 1: $180,000 - $200,000 (high initial usage)
- Year 2: $160,000 - $180,000 (optimized)
- Year 3: $150,000 - $170,000 (fully optimized)

3-Year Total: $490,000 - $550,000

COMPARISON: CLOUD VS ON-PREMISE
--------------------------------

For equivalent dev/test infrastructure:
- Cloud (3 years): $508,000 - $553,000
- On-Premise: $300,000 - $400,000 (servers + maintenance)

Cloud advantages:
- No upfront capital
- Elastic scaling
- Global availability
- Managed services

On-Premise advantages:
- Lower long-term cost
- Complete control
- No egress fees
- Better for HFT production

HYBRID RECOMMENDATION:
- Production: 100% on-premise (latency critical)
- Dev/Test: 80% cloud, 20% on-premise
- Analytics: 100% cloud (cost-effective)
- DR/Backup: 50% cloud, 50% on-premise
