Note: This assumes no trading revenue, only costs.
Actual profitability depends on trading performance.

================================================================================

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------

MINIMUM CAPITAL NEEDED:
- Development & Operations (3 years): $32M - $41M
- Trading Capital: $10M - $50M
- Reserve Fund: $5M - $10M
- TOTAL: $47M - $101M

RECOMMENDED CAPITAL:
- Development & Operations: $40M
- Trading Capital: $50M
- Reserve Fund: $10M
- TOTAL: $100M

This provides adequate runway and trading capital for success.

================================================================================

COST PER TRADE ANALYSIS
------------------------

Assumptions:
- Average daily volume: 50M shares (Year 3)
- Trading days: 252 per year
- Annual volume: 12.6B shares

Annual Operating Cost (Year 3): $9,134,120 - $12,003,873

Cost per Share: $0.000725 - $0.000953

For comparison:
- Maker rebate: -$0.0020 per share (revenue)
- Taker fee: +$0.0025 per share (cost)
- Operating overhead: +$0.0009 per share

Net cost per share (50% maker/taker): +$0.001125

Required edge to be profitable: >$0.0011 per share

================================================================================

BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS
------------------

To breakeven on $10M annual operating costs:

Scenario 1 - Market Making (rebates):
- Need: $10M in net rebates
- At $0.0010 per share net: 10B shares/year
- Daily volume: 40M shares
- Achievable with aggressive market making

Scenario 2 - Spread Capture:
- Need: $10M in gross profits
- At $0.005 per share captured: 2B shares/year
- Daily volume: 8M shares with 100% capture
- More conservative, lower volume needed

Scenario 3 - Mixed Strategy:
- $5M from rebates (20M shares/day)
- $5M from alpha (1B shares/year, $0.005/share)
- More diversified risk

================================================================================

SCALABILITY
-----------

COST SCALING BY OPERATION SIZE:

SMALL (3-5 Exchanges, $50M-$200M daily volume):
- Team: 6-8 engineers
- 3-Year TCO: $12M - $18M
- Breakeven volume: 15M shares/day

MEDIUM (5-10 Exchanges, $200M-$1B daily volume):
- Team: 10-15 engineers
- 3-Year TCO: $26M - $38.5M (this estimate)
- Breakeven volume: 40M shares/day

LARGE (10+ Exchanges, $1B+ daily volume):
- Team: 20-30 engineers
- 3-Year TCO: $45M - $75M
- Breakeven volume: 100M shares/day

Larger operations have:
- Higher absolute costs
- Better economies of scale
- Lower cost per share
- Higher competitive moats

================================================================================

COST OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
--------------------------

POTENTIAL SAVINGS BY CATEGORY:

1. Development (-20% with remote hiring, AI tools): Save $2M - $3M
2. Infrastructure (-30% phased deployment): Save $2M - $3M
3. Exchange Fees (market making rebates): +$8M - $15M revenue
4. Data (-40% using OSS, exchange data): Save $2M - $3M
5. Software (-60% using open source): Save $600K - $900K
6. Regulatory (-30% sponsored access): Save $1M - $2M

Total Potential Savings: $7.6M - $11.9M (20-30% reduction)
Optimized 3-Year TCO: $18M - $27M

================================================================================

COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES
---------------------------

BUILD vs BUY vs HYBRID:

BUILD (Custom System):
- Cost: $26M - $38.5M over 3 years
- Pros: Full control, proprietary tech, competitive edge
- Cons: High upfront cost, long time to market

BUY (Commercial Platform):
- License fees: $1M - $3M/year
- Customization: $2M - $5M
- 3-Year: $5M - $14M
- Pros: Faster deployment, lower risk
- Cons: Limited customization, vendor lock-in, shared tech

HYBRID (Build Core, Buy Peripherals):
- Core trading: Custom ($10M - $15M)
- Risk, monitoring: Commercial ($3M - $5M)
- 3-Year: $13M - $20M
- Pros: Balanced approach, faster to market
- Cons: Integration complexity

For serious HFT firms, BUILD is recommended despite higher cost.
The competitive advantage and customization justify the investment.

================================================================================

FUNDING STRATEGY
----------------

RECOMMENDED FUNDING MILESTONES:

SEED/PRE-LAUNCH ($15M - $25M):
- Year 1 development: $14M - $18M
- Working capital: $1M - $2M
- Buffer: $2M - $5M

SERIES A ($25M - $50M):
- Year 2 operations: $9M - $12M
- Trading capital expansion: $10M - $25M
- Geographic expansion: $5M - $10M
- Buffer: $1M - $3M

REVENUE/PROFITABILITY:
- Year 3 should be self-sustaining
- No additional capital needed if profitable

TOTAL EXTERNAL FUNDING NEEDED: $40M - $75M

Alternative: Proprietary trading firm (no external funding)
- Use founder/partner capital
- Slower growth, lower risk
- 3-5 year timeline to full scale

================================================================================

CONCLUSION
----------

Building a competitive HFT system requires $26M - $38.5M over 3 years.
This is a significant investment but achievable with proper planning and execution.

Success factors:
1. Adequate capitalization ($50M - $100M total with trading capital)
2. Experienced team with HFT expertise
3. Strong technology foundation
4. Regulatory compliance from day one
5. Phased approach to manage cash flow
6. Clear path to profitability

The high costs are offset by:
- Market making rebates (can turn fees into revenue)
- Competitive advantages from proprietary technology
- Scalability once infrastructure is built
- Decreasing marginal costs as volume grows

For firms with $100M+ in capital and experienced teams,
the HFT business model remains highly attractive despite
the significant upfront investment required.
