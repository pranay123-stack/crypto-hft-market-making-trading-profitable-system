REJECTED: MOD-2025-REJ-007 - Complete System Rewrite in Rust
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTION DATE: 2025-11-12
REVIEW PERIOD: 2025-11-05 to 2025-11-12

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
Submitted: 2025-11-05
Submitted By: Kevin Zhang, Senior Developer
Business Sponsor: None (technical proposal)
Priority: Medium
Estimated Effort: 18-24 months, 40,000+ hours

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
Complete rewrite of HFT trading system from C++ to Rust. Rationale:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Modern language features
- Better concurrency primitives
- Growing ecosystem
- Long-term maintainability

Proposed approach:
- Rewrite core components over 24 months
- Gradual migration strategy
- Maintain feature parity
- Improve performance where possible

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION PROVIDED:
- Reduced memory-related bugs
- Easier recruitment (Rust gaining popularity)
- Improved developer productivity
- Performance improvements (claimed 10-20%)
- Better concurrency safety

TECHNICAL REVIEW FINDINGS:
[2025-11-08] Technical review by Architecture Team

Concerns Raised:
1. Massive undertaking with unclear ROI
2. Current C++ codebase is well-optimized and stable
3. Team lacks deep Rust expertise (training needed)
4. Risk of introducing new bugs during rewrite
5. 24-month timeline means 2 years of reduced feature velocity
6. Rust ecosystem for HFT not as mature as C++
7. Performance claims unsubstantiated for our use case
8. No clear path to maintain both systems during transition

Technical Assessment:
- Rust is interesting but not clearly better for our needs
- C++ continues to evolve (C++20, C++23)
- Our C++ codebase is mature and well-understood
- Memory safety issues are manageable with good practices
- Concurrency patterns work well in current system

RISK ASSESSMENT:
[2025-11-10] Risk review by Risk Management

Risk Level: CRITICAL
- Complete rewrite = complete re-testing needed
- 24-month period of system instability risk
- Knowledge transfer challenges
- Potential performance regressions
- Business disruption during transition
- Unclear fallback if rewrite fails
- Financial risk: $8M+ investment with uncertain return

CAB DISCUSSION:
[2025-11-12] Change Advisory Board Meeting

Key Discussion Points:
- No compelling business driver for change
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" principle applies
- Resources better spent on business value-add features
- Risk/reward ratio extremely unfavorable
- Rust interesting but not necessary for success
- Current system performs well and is reliable
- Rewrite projects have high failure rate in industry

Vote: Unanimous rejection

REJECTION DECISION:
Decision: REJECTED
Rejection Reason: Risk far exceeds potential benefits, no compelling business case

Detailed Rationale:
1. BUSINESS CASE INSUFFICIENT
   - No clear business problem being solved
   - Current system meets all performance requirements
   - No customer/trader complaints about current system
   - ROI calculation not credible (assumes problems that don't exist)

2. RISK UNACCEPTABLE
   - Complete rewrite = complete re-introduction of risks
   - 24 months of reduced velocity unacceptable
   - Trading system stability is paramount
   - Cannot jeopardize working system for theoretical benefits

3. RESOURCE ALLOCATION UNJUSTIFIED
   - 40,000+ hours = 20 person-years
   - Cost: $8M+ with no clear return
   - Opportunity cost: What features could we build instead?
   - Team training: 6+ months before productive in Rust

4. TECHNICAL CONCERNS
   - Rust ecosystem less mature for HFT applications
   - C++ tooling and libraries well-established
   - Performance claims not backed by benchmarks
   - Current C++ codebase is well-architected
   - Memory safety achievable with good C++ practices

5. TIMING POOR
   - Multiple strategic initiatives underway
   - Business needs new features, not rewrites
   - Team stability important (rewrite causes turnover)

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Invest in C++ code quality and safety tools
   - Static analysis (we already use some)
   - Sanitizers (address, thread, undefined behavior)
   - Code review focus on memory safety
   - Training on modern C++ best practices

2. Selective Rust adoption for NEW components
   - Try Rust for non-critical new services
   - Build expertise gradually
   - Prove value before major commitment
   - Allows evaluation with limited risk

3. Incremental improvements to current system
   - Upgrade to C++20/23 for better features
   - Improve testing coverage
   - Performance optimization where needed
   - Focus on maintainability

4. Focus on business value
   - Build features traders need
   - Improve system observability
   - Enhance risk management
   - Optimize what matters

LESSONS LEARNED:
1. Large rewrites rarely justified in production systems
2. Technology choice should follow business needs, not vice versa
3. "Resume-driven development" is not a valid justification
4. Stability and reliability trump "cool technology"
5. Incremental improvement usually better than revolution

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:
This proposal may be reconsidered if:
- Business requirements change significantly
- C++ ecosystem fails to evolve
- Rust HFT ecosystem matures substantially
- We encounter fundamental C++ limitations
- Team naturally develops Rust expertise
- Competitive landscape changes

However, complete rewrite remains unlikely. Incremental adoption more probable.

REQUESTOR FEEDBACK:
[2025-11-14] Kevin Zhang acknowledged the decision and agreed with the
rationale. Appreciated the thorough review. Proposed instead to evaluate
Rust for a new ancillary service (lower risk). CAB supportive of this
approach.

IMPACT OF REJECTION:
Positive outcome: Led to productive discussion about technology choices.
Resulted in approval for Rust trial in non-critical service. Strengthened
understanding of when rewrites make sense. Team aligned on incremental
improvement approach.

STATUS: Rejected - Alternative approaches in progress

REJECTED: MOD-2025-REJ-006 - AI-Based Trade Execution Optimization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTION DATE: 2025-11-08
REVIEW PERIOD: 2025-10-28 to 2025-11-08

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
Submitted: 2025-10-28
Submitted By: Dr. Amy Chen, Quantitative Researcher
Business Sponsor: Head of Trading (tentative)
Priority: High
Estimated Effort: 800 hours + ongoing ML infrastructure

PROPOSAL SUMMARY:
Use machine learning to optimize trade execution decisions in real-time.
Model would learn from historical execution data to predict optimal
execution strategies. Proposed deep learning approach with real-time
inference.

Key Features:
- Neural network model for execution strategy selection
- Real-time inference (<10ms)
- Continuous learning from execution outcomes
- A/B testing framework
- Gradual rollout by strategy

Claimed Benefits:
- 15-25% improvement in execution quality
- Reduced market impact
- Better handling of market microstructure
- Adaptive to changing market conditions

TECHNICAL REVIEW FINDINGS:
[2025-11-01] Technical review by Architecture + ML Team

Concerns:
1. ML model interpretability critical for trading decisions
2. Real-time inference latency challenging (10ms aggressive)
3. Training data quality and bias concerns
4. Model drift and retraining complexity
5. Infrastructure requirements substantial
6. Regulatory explainability requirements
7. Integration complexity with existing execution logic
8. A/B testing in live trading has risks

Technical Assessment:
- ML for trading is promising but immature
- Interpretability requirements not addressed
- Latency requirements may not be achievable
- Infrastructure investment significant
- Risk of model making incorrect decisions

RISK ASSESSMENT:
[2025-11-03] Risk review by Risk Management

Risk Level: HIGH
- Model could make suboptimal decisions (financial impact)
- Black box decision making (regulatory concern)
- Model reliability under stress conditions unknown
- Potential for model to amplify bad patterns in training data
- Real-time inference failure modes not fully analyzed
- Difficulty detecting model degradation

Risk Manager Comments:
"While ML is exciting, using it for real-time trading decisions without
full explainability is concerning. We need to understand why the model
makes each decision. Deep learning models are notoriously opaque."

BUSINESS ANALYSIS:
[2025-11-05] Business review

Questions:
- 15-25% improvement claim based on backtest or reality?
- What is current execution quality baseline?
- How does this compare to simpler rule-based improvements?
- What is fallback if model performs poorly?
- Ongoing cost of ML infrastructure?

Business Analyst Notes:
"Backtest results often don't translate to live trading. Need more
conservative estimates. Simpler improvements may achieve 80% of benefit
with 20% of complexity."

COMPLIANCE REVIEW:
[2025-11-06] Compliance team review

Regulatory Concerns:
- MiFID II requires explainability of trading decisions
- Model decisions must be auditable
- Need documentation of model logic
- Model changes require approval process
- Risk of algorithmic trading violations

Compliance Officer:
"Cannot approve black box decision making for trade execution. Need
clear documentation of model logic and decision factors."

CAB DISCUSSION:
[2025-11-08] Change Advisory Board Meeting

Key Points:
- Exciting technology but premature for production
- Risk/reward not favorable given unknowns
- Regulatory concerns significant
- Simpler approaches should be tried first
- ML infrastructure investment not justified yet
- Team lacks production ML experience

Concerns About Proposal:
- Over-reliance on backtesting results
- Underestimation of production ML complexity
- Insufficient risk mitigation
- Regulatory compliance not addressed
- Alternative approaches not explored

REJECTION DECISION:
Decision: REJECTED (current form)
Rejection Reason: Premature, insufficient risk mitigation, regulatory concerns

Detailed Rationale:
1. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ISSUES
   - Explainability requirements not met
   - Audit trail concerns
   - Model governance process undefined
   - Cannot deploy without compliance approval

2. TECHNICAL IMMATURITY
   - Production ML infrastructure doesn't exist
   - Real-time inference latency unproven
   - Model monitoring and management undefined
   - Fail-safe mechanisms inadequate

3. RISK MANAGEMENT CONCERNS
   - Black box decision making unacceptable for trading
   - Model failure modes not fully analyzed
   - Financial exposure inadequately controlled
   - Reputational risk if model behaves unexpectedly

4. BUSINESS CASE UNCERTAINTY
   - Performance claims based on backtesting (notoriously unreliable)
   - No comparison to simpler alternatives
   - Implementation cost and timeline optimistic
   - Ongoing operational cost underestimated

5. CAPABILITY GAPS
   - Team lacks production ML experience
   - No ML infrastructure in place
   - ML operations expertise needed
   - Model risk management framework missing

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. START WITH SIMPLER APPROACHES
   - Rule-based execution improvements
   - Statistical models (interpretable)
   - Traditional quantitative methods
   - Build baseline before adding ML complexity

2. BUILD ML CAPABILITIES GRADUALLY
   - Start with ML for non-critical applications
   - Build ML infrastructure and expertise
   - Develop model governance framework
   - Establish regulatory compliance approach

3. RESEARCH BEFORE PRODUCTION
   - Extended research phase with paper trading
   - Partner with academic institutions
   - Evaluate interpretable ML approaches
   - Benchmark against simple alternatives

4. PILOT WITH LIMITED SCOPE
   - If pursued, start with single strategy
   - Low capital allocation initially
   - Manual oversight initially
   - Prove value before expansion

FUTURE PATH FORWARD:
[Conditional approval pending prerequisites]

CAB willing to reconsider if:
1. ML infrastructure in place
2. Model interpretability addressed
3. Regulatory compliance framework established
4. Team develops ML expertise
5. Simpler alternatives exhausted
6. Paper trading shows consistent results (6+ months)
7. Risk framework for ML decisions developed

Recommended Timeline:
- Phase 1 (6 months): Build ML infrastructure, simpler improvements
- Phase 2 (6 months): Research and paper trading
- Phase 3 (3 months): Limited pilot if Phase 2 successful
- Phase 4: Gradual rollout if pilot successful
Total: 15+ months before production consideration

REQUESTOR RESPONSE:
[2025-11-10] Dr. Amy Chen understood the concerns and agreed to revised
approach. Will focus on interpretable models and build infrastructure
first. Appreciates the structured path forward.

IMPACT OF REJECTION:
Positive: Led to more thoughtful ML strategy. Approved smaller initiative
to build ML infrastructure for non-trading applications first. Enabled
learning without production risk.

STATUS: Rejected - Phased alternative approach approved

2. Kubernetes adds significant complexity
3. Trading systems require deterministic behavior
4. Latency considerations with Kubernetes networking
5. Learning curve for operations team
6. Migration risk during transition
7. Some services require bare metal performance

Assessment:
"Kubernetes solves problems we don't have. Our deployment needs are
relatively simple and current approach works well. Added complexity
not justified for our use case."

OPERATIONS REVIEW:
[2025-10-18] Operations team review

Operations Perspective:
- Current system simple and reliable
- Team knows how to troubleshoot
- No scaling issues currently
- Kubernetes would require significant retraining
- Concern about debugging complexity in production

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
[2025-10-20] Performance team review

Performance Concerns:
- Kubernetes networking overhead (service mesh adds latency)
- Container overhead vs. bare metal
- Resource isolation may impact performance
- Determinism harder in Kubernetes
- CPU pinning and NUMA awareness more complex

Performance Engineer:
"Our trading systems need microsecond latency. Kubernetes abstractions
may add unpredictable latency."

CAB DISCUSSION:
[2025-10-22] Change Advisory Board Meeting

Discussion Summary:
- Kubernetes is good technology but not necessary for us
- Would be adopting technology because it's popular, not because we need it
- Current system serves our needs
- Risk/complexity not justified by benefits
- Resource utilization not a problem currently
- Scaling needs met by current approach

REJECTION DECISION:
Decision: REJECTED
Rejection Reason: Solution in search of a problem

Detailed Rationale:
1. NO COMPELLING PROBLEM
   - Current deployment works well
   - No scaling issues
   - Deployment process acceptable
   - Resource utilization adequate

2. ADDED COMPLEXITY UNJUSTIFIED

   - Service mesh latency unacceptable
   - Bare metal performance needed

4. OPERATIONAL RISK
   - Team would need extensive training
   - Incident response harder initially
   - Migration risk
   - More things that can go wrong

5. COST NOT JUSTIFIED
   - Development time: 600+ hours
   - Training time: 200+ hours
   - Ongoing complexity
   - No clear ROI

ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Improve current deployment
   - Better monitoring
   - Automated testing
   - Documentation improvements
   - Keep it simple

2. Consider containers without Kubernetes
   - Docker for packaging
   - Simple orchestration
   - Less complexity than K8s

3. Evaluate for new services only
   - Don't migrate existing
   - Try K8s for non-critical new services
   - Learn without production risk

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Don't adopt technology for technology's sake
- Simple solutions often better than complex
- Performance requirements drive architecture
- Team capabilities matter for technology choice
- "Industry standard" doesn't mean "right for us"

REQUESTOR FEEDBACK:
[2025-10-24] Infrastructure team accepted decision. Agreed to focus on
improving current system rather than wholesale replacement.

STATUS: Rejected - Focus on incremental improvements

================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTED: MOD-2025-REJ-002 - Implement Microservices Architecture
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTION DATE: 2025-08-30
Similar to Kubernetes rejection - adding complexity without clear benefit.

Current monolithic architecture works well for our needs. Microservices
would add significant operational complexity, network overhead, and
distributed system challenges without commensurate benefits.

Decision: Rejected - Keep current architecture
Alternative: Better modularity within existing architecture

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTED: MOD-2025-REJ-001 - NoSQL Database Migration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REJECTION DATE: 2025-07-18
Proposal to migrate from PostgreSQL to NoSQL (MongoDB proposed).

Rejected because:
- PostgreSQL performs well for our needs
- NoSQL doesn't solve any actual problem we have
- Trading data relational by nature
- Transaction support critical (ACID properties)
- Team expertise in PostgreSQL strong
- Migration risk high

Decision: Rejected - PostgreSQL is the right tool for our data

================================================================================
                         PATTERNS IN REJECTIONS
================================================================================

COMMON THEMES:
1. Technology-Driven Rather Than Business-Driven
   - Wanting to use "cool" technology
   - Solution looking for a problem
   - Resume-driven development

2. Underestimating Complexity
   - "It'll be easy to..."
   - Not considering operational burden
   - Ignoring learning curve

3. Overestimating Benefits
   - Optimistic ROI projections
   - Assuming backtests will translate to reality
   - Ignoring existing solutions

4. Inadequate Risk Analysis
   - Not considering downside
   - Assuming success
   - Insufficient fallback planning

5. Ignoring Constraints
   - Performance requirements
   - Regulatory compliance
   - Team capabilities
   - Operational complexity

SUCCESSFUL PROPOSALS AVOID THESE PITFALLS BY:
- Starting with clear business problem
- Realistic benefit estimation
- Thorough risk analysis
- Appropriate technology choice
- Phased implementation plans
- Consideration of alternatives
- Respect for operational simplicity

================================================================================
                         KEY LESSONS LEARNED
================================================================================

1. SIMPLICITY IS A FEATURE
   Simple solutions often better than complex ones. Complexity is a cost.

2. BUSINESS VALUE FIRST
   Technology choices should follow business needs, not vice versa.

3. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
   Make sure you're solving a real problem, not an imagined one.

4. CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES
   Often simpler alternatives exist that deliver 80% of value.

5. RESPECT OPERATIONS
   Systems that are hard to operate will cause ongoing pain.

6. PERFORMANCE MATTERS
   For HFT systems, microseconds matter. Abstractions have cost.

7. TEAM CAPABILITIES MATTER
   Technology you can't support is a liability.

8. INCREMENTAL BETTER THAN REVOLUTIONARY
   Big rewrites and migrations rarely succeed. Incremental improvement safer.

9. MEASURE TWICE, CUT ONCE
   Thorough analysis prevents wasted effort.

10. IT'S OKAY TO SAY NO
    Saying no to bad ideas is as important as saying yes to good ones.

================================================================================
                              CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Rejecting modifications is a normal and healthy part of the change management
process. Not every idea should be implemented. Good gatekeeping protects the
system, the team, and the business from unnecessary complexity, risk, and
wasted resources.

The goal is not to reject ideas arbitrarily, but to ensure that implemented
changes deliver real business value, are technically sound, adequately manage
risk, and respect operational constraints.

Many rejected proposals lead to better alternatives. The review process helps
refine thinking and focus resources on what truly matters.
