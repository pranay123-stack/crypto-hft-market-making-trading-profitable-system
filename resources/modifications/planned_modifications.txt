SUBMITTED BY: Sarah Chen, Lead Trading Engineer
BUSINESS SPONSOR: Michael Torres, Head of Trading
ESTIMATED EFFORT: 160 hours
TARGET COMPLETION: 2025-12-10

SUMMARY:
Current market data processing latency averaging 250μs is causing missed
arbitrage opportunities. Analysis shows $75K-$100K daily revenue impact.
Competitor analysis indicates industry standard is 100-150μs. Proposed
optimization involves:
- Lock-free queue implementation for market data
- NUMA-aware memory allocation
- CPU pinning for critical threads
- Kernel bypass optimization

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- Revenue: +$1.5M - $2M annually
- Competitive Position: Brings us to industry parity
- Risk: Reduces missed opportunity risk

RISK LEVEL: HIGH
- Performance regression risk if not tested thoroughly
- Requires extensive market simulation testing
- Complex deployment (requires system restart during off-hours)

TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY: HIGH
- Affects core market data pipeline
- Requires C++ template metaprogramming
- NUMA/CPU architecture expertise needed
- Performance profiling and optimization

DEPENDENCIES:
- None (standalone optimization)

KEY RISKS:
1. Performance regression in edge cases
2. NUMA architecture assumptions may not hold on all hardware
3. Requires careful thread affinity management

NEXT STEPS:
- CAB review scheduled for 2025-11-26
- Performance baseline tests in progress
- Hardware configuration audit needed

REVIEW NOTES:
[2025-11-20] Technical review completed by James Liu (Architect)
- Design approved with recommendations for additional memory barrier analysis
- Suggested phased rollout with per-symbol canary testing

[2025-11-22] Risk assessment completed by Risk Management
