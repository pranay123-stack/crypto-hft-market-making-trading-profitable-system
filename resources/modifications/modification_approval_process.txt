                              INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
This document provides comprehensive guidance on the modification approval
process for the HFT trading system. Understanding and following this process
is essential for successful change implementation.

WHO SHOULD READ THIS:
- Anyone proposing system modifications
- Developers implementing changes
- Business sponsors requesting features
- New team members
- External consultants
- Audit and compliance teams

PROCESS PHILOSOPHY:
The approval process balances:

- Transparency: Clear decision-making and accountability
- Learning: Continuous improvement from experience

GOAL: Enable rapid delivery of valuable changes while maintaining system
reliability and managing risk appropriately.

NOT BUREAUCRACY: This process exists to enable change safely, not to block
it. Well-prepared requests move quickly. The process helps refine ideas and
focus resources effectively.

================================================================================
                          APPROVAL PROCESS OVERVIEW
================================================================================

HIGH-LEVEL FLOW:
1. Pre-Submission Consultation (informal)
2. Request Preparation (requestor)
3. Initial Submission (requestor → CAB)
4. Technical Review (senior developer + architect)
5. Risk Assessment (risk team)
6. Security Review (if applicable)
7. Compliance Review (if applicable)
8. CAB Review & Decision (Change Advisory Board)
9. Implementation (if approved)
10. Post-Implementation Review (after deployment)

TYPICAL TIMELINE:
- Low Complexity: 5-7 days
- Medium Complexity: 10-14 days
- High Complexity: 14-21 days
- Critical Emergency: 1-3 hours (fast-track)

APPROVAL RATE: ~75% of well-prepared requests approved
Rejection Rate: ~20% rejected, ~5% withdrawn

KEYS TO FAST APPROVAL:
✓ Complete request with all sections filled
✓ Clear business justification with metrics
✓ Realistic effort estimates
✓ Thorough risk assessment
✓ Well-thought-out testing plan
✓ Detailed deployment plan
✓ Validated rollback procedure
✓ Consultation with stakeholders before submission

================================================================================
                       STEP 1: PRE-SUBMISSION PHASE
================================================================================

BEFORE YOU SUBMIT:
------------------
DO NOT just fill out the template and submit. Preparation is key to success.

Step 1.1: Informal Discussion
Talk to your team lead about your idea:
- Is this the right problem to solve?
- Has this been tried before?
- Are there simpler alternatives?
- Is timing right?
- What are the key risks?

Step 1.2: Stakeholder Consultation
Identify and consult with stakeholders:
- Who will be affected by this change?
- Who needs to approve?
- Who can provide input?
- Who will use the result?

Key Stakeholders by Change Type:
- Trading Logic: Head of Trading, Risk Manager, Traders
- Risk Management: Risk Manager, Compliance, Trading
- Infrastructure: Operations, Security, All dev teams
- Data/Reporting: Business Analysts, Compliance, Trading
- Security: CISO, Compliance, Operations
- API: External clients, Business Development, API team

Step 1.3: Research & Analysis
Do your homework:
- Review similar past modifications (completed_modifications.txt)
- Check for rejected similar requests (rejected_modifications.txt)
- Research alternatives
- Gather supporting data
- Create rough design
- Get informal feedback

Step 1.4: Business Case Development
Quantify the value:
- What problem does this solve?
- What is the business impact ($$$ terms)?
- What is the cost of NOT doing it?
- What alternatives exist?
- Why is this the right approach?
- What is the ROI?

Step 1.5: Technical Feasibility
Validate technical approach:
- Is it technically feasible?
- What are the technical risks?
- Do we have the skills?
- Do we have the infrastructure?
- What are the dependencies?
- How long will it really take?

CHECKPOINT:
Before proceeding, ask yourself:
- Can I clearly articulate the business value?
- Do I understand the risks?
- Have I consulted key stakeholders?
- Is my approach technically sound?
- Is timing right given other priorities?

If you answer NO to any of these, do more preparation.

PRE-SUBMISSION REVIEW:
Schedule 30-minute review with senior developer:
- Present idea and approach
- Get feedback
- Identify gaps
- Refine proposal
- Confirm feasibility

This informal review significantly increases approval chances.
