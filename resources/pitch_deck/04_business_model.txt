CUSTOMER ECONOMICS
------------------

CUSTOMER VALUE PROPOSITION:

Typical customer ROI calculation (Professional tier customer):

Annual cost to customer:
- Software license: $420,000
- Transaction fees: $600,000 (assuming $500M avg monthly volume)
- Professional services: $100,000 (one-time integration + training)
- Total Year 1 cost: $1,120,000
- Ongoing annual cost: $1,020,000

Alternative (building in-house):
- Development cost: $2,000,000-$5,000,000 (Year 1)
- Ongoing maintenance: $1,000,000-$2,000,000/year
- Team required: 8-12 engineers
- Time to market: 12-18 months
- Total 3-year cost: $5,000,000-$11,000,000

Our solution 3-year cost: $3,160,000

Savings: $1,840,000 - $7,840,000 (38-71% cost reduction)

Plus additional benefits:
- Faster time to market (2 weeks vs 12-18 months)
- Better performance (0.8ms vs 5-50ms typical in-house)
- No team management overhead
- Continuous improvements and updates
- 24/7 support

PERFORMANCE-BASED VALUE:

Latency advantage creates trading alpha:

Example: Market-making strategy
- Opportunity window: 50-200ms typically
- Our latency: 0.8ms (can capture 100% of opportunities)
- Competitor latency: 15ms (can capture ~70% of opportunities)
- In-house solution: 25ms (can capture ~50% of opportunities)

If strategy generates $5M/year with perfect execution:
- With our system: $5.0M (100%)
- With competitor: $3.5M (70%)
- With in-house: $2.5M (50%)

Incremental value from our system: $1.5M-$2.5M/year
Our cost: $1.02M/year
Net benefit: $480K-$1.48M/year
ROI: 47-145%

This analysis assumes conservative 30-50% execution efficiency degradation
with higher latency. Some customers report even larger impacts.

CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST (CAC):

CAC breakdown:

Sales & Marketing:
- Sales team compensation: $15,000 (loaded cost per deal)
- Marketing programs: $8,000 (allocated per deal)
- Conference/events: $5,000 (allocated per deal)
- Demo/POC costs: $4,000 (infrastructure + time)
- Legal/contracting: $3,000 (per deal)

Total CAC: $35,000 per customer

CAC by customer tier:
- Starter: $15,000 (lower touch sales)
- Professional: $35,000 (standard sales process)
- Enterprise: $75,000 (complex sales, longer cycle)

Weighted average CAC: $35,000

CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE (LTV):

LTV calculation (Professional tier customer):

Annual revenue per customer: $420,000 (Year 1 average)
Gross margin: 80%
Annual gross profit: $336,000
Average customer lifetime: 6.2 years
Customer lifetime gross profit: $2,083,200

Net dollar retention: 142% (customers expand usage over time)

Year 1: $420,000 revenue
Year 2: $596,400 (42% expansion)
Year 3: $846,888
Year 4: $1,202,581 (typically converts to Enterprise tier)
Year 5: $1,500,000 (Enterprise pricing)
Year 6: $1,800,000

6-year total revenue: $6,365,869
6-year gross profit: $5,092,695

LTV: $5,092,695
CAC: $35,000
LTV/CAC: 145:1

Conservative LTV (assuming 5-year lifetime, no expansion):
LTV: $1,680,000 (5 years × $336K gross profit)
LTV/CAC: 48:1

Even in conservative scenario, exceptional unit economics.

PAYBACK PERIOD:

Time to recover CAC:

Starter tier:
- Monthly gross profit: $8,000
- Months to payback: 1.9 months

Professional tier:
- Monthly gross profit: $28,000
- Months to payback: 1.3 months

Enterprise tier:
- Monthly gross profit: $80,000
- Months to payback: 0.9 months

Weighted average payback: 1.4 months

Remarkably fast payback enables aggressive growth investment.

REVENUE RETENTION AND EXPANSION
--------------------------------

GROSS REVENUE RETENTION (GRR):

Historical retention (2023-2024):
- Customer churn: 0% (all 12 customers retained)
- Logo retention: 100%
- Revenue churn: 0%

Gross revenue retention: 100%

Projected retention (steady state):
- Annual logo churn: 5%
- Revenue churn from logo loss: 5%
- Revenue churn from downgrade: 2%

Projected GRR: 93% (conservative)

NET DOLLAR RETENTION (NDR):

Expansion revenue sources:

1. Volume growth (most common):
   - Customer trading volume grows over time
   - Transaction fees increase
   - Typical growth: 25-40% annually

2. Adding exchange connectors:
   - Start with 5 exchanges, expand to 10+
   - Additional $10K-$20K MRR per customer

3. Additional trading desks:
   - Firms grow teams, add desks
   - $8K/month per additional desk
   - Typical expansion: 2-3 desks over 2 years

4. Tier upgrades:
   - Starter → Professional: ~50% of Starter customers by Year 2
   - Professional → Enterprise: ~25% of Professional by Year 3

5. Professional services:
   - Custom strategy development
   - Ongoing optimization
   - Recurring consultation

6. Data services add-ons:
   - Historical data
   - Enhanced real-time feeds
   - Custom analytics

Expansion revenue:
- Year 1: 25% of base (mostly volume growth)
- Year 2: 42% of base (volume + new exchanges + services)
- Year 3: 38% of base (continued expansion, some saturation)
- Year 4-6: 30-35% of base

Net dollar retention calculation:

Year 1 cohort: $1,000,000 revenue
Year 2: $1,000,000 × (1 - 5% churn) × (1 + 42% expansion) = $1,349,000
NDR: 135%

Conservative scenario (lower expansion):
Year 2: $1,000,000 × (1 - 7% churn) × (1 + 30% expansion) = $1,209,000
NDR: 121%

Aggressive scenario (high expansion):
Year 2: $1,000,000 × (1 - 3% churn) × (1 + 50% expansion) = $1,455,000
NDR: 146%

Target NDR: 135-145%

This level of NDR indicates very strong product-market fit and pricing power.

- Significant discount to legacy vendors (value-based pricing)
- Massive discount to in-house (total cost of ownership)

Price positioning: 70% of legacy vendor pricing, 200% of performance

VALUE-BASED PRICING:

Alternative approach for Enterprise customers:

Revenue share model:
- Customer pays 10-20% of incremental profit from using our system
- Requires baseline establishment
- Aligns incentives perfectly
- Higher total revenue potential
- More complex to administer

Example:
- Customer generates $10M/year trading profit without our system
- With our system: $15M/year (50% improvement from latency advantage)
- Incremental profit: $5M
- Our fee (15%): $750,000/year
- vs fixed fee: $1,200,000/year

Could offer as option for select customers. Risk/reward profile may appeal
to some customers.

BUSINESS MODEL RISKS AND MITIGATION
------------------------------------

KEY RISKS:

1. CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION:
   Risk: Large customers represent significant revenue
   Impact: Losing one customer could impact 10-20% of revenue

   Mitigation:
   - Diversify customer base (target 100+ customers by Year 3)
   - No single customer >10% of revenue
   - Long-term contracts with large customers
   - High switching costs (integration, training, customization)
   - Focus on customer success and retention

2. PRICE PRESSURE:
   Risk: Competition or customer pressure to reduce prices
   Impact: 10-20% price reduction would significantly impact margins

   Mitigation:
   - Maintain technology differentiation (performance advantage)
   - Value-based pricing (demonstrated ROI)
   - Bundle additional services
   - Annual price increases (5-10%)
   - Focus on value, not price

3. TRANSACTION FEE VOLATILITY:
   Risk: 25% of revenue depends on trading volume (market dependent)
   Impact: Crypto bear market could reduce volume 50-70%

   Mitigation:
   - Minimum monthly commitments
   - Shift revenue mix toward fixed subscription (60% target)
   - Multi-year contracts lock in pricing
   - Customers trade in bull and bear markets (volatility is good)

4. SALES CYCLE EXTENSION:
   Risk: Enterprise sales can take 6-12 months
   Impact: Slower revenue growth, higher CAC

   Mitigation:
   - Product-led growth for smaller customers (self-service)
   - Fast deployment (2 weeks) reduces time to value
   - Pilot programs to accelerate decision
   - Strong ROI case shortens evaluation

5. CHURN:
   Risk: Customers may leave for competitors or in-house
   Impact: Each 1% increase in churn reduces LTV by ~15%

   Mitigation:
   - High switching costs
   - Continuous product improvement
   - Customer success team
   - Performance guarantees
   - Currently 0% churn (maintain <5% long-term)

ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS CONSIDERED:

1. FREEMIUM:
   Pros: Large user base, low CAC, viral growth
   Cons: Crypto trading requires security/compliance, not suitable for free
   Decision: Not pursuing (B2B institutional focus)

2. USAGE-BASED ONLY (no fixed fees):
   Pros: Perfect alignment with customer value
   Cons: Revenue unpredictability, customer concentration risk
   Decision: Hybrid model better (60% fixed, 25% variable)

3. REVENUE SHARE:
   Pros: Perfect incentive alignment
   Cons: Complex to measure, requires trust, hard to scale
   Decision: Offer as option for select customers

4. SEAT-BASED ONLY (no volume fees):
   Pros: Simple, predictable
   Cons: Misses large customer revenue potential
   Decision: Use as base, add volume fees

5. HARDWARE APPLIANCE:
   Pros: Higher margins, switching cost
   Cons: CapEx model (slower sales), deployment complexity
   Decision: Software-only, but offer private deployment

FINAL MODEL SELECTION RATIONALE:

Chosen model: Subscription base + usage fees + services

Reasoning:
- Predictable recurring revenue (60% fixed)
- Scales with customer success (25% variable)
- Diversified revenue streams (4 streams)
- High margins (78-90%)
- Exceptional unit economics (LTV/CAC 60:1)
- Aligns with customer value creation
- Supports efficient scaling
- Attractive to investors (SaaS multiples)
