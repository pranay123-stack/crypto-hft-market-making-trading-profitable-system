INVESTOR RETURN SCENARIOS
--------------------------

INVESTMENT: $12M for 24% ownership (post-money)

After Series B (assumed 15% dilution):
Investor ownership: 20.4% (diluted from 24%)

EXIT SCENARIOS:

CONSERVATIVE (Exit Year 5, $350M valuation):
Investor proceeds: $71.4M (20.4% × $350M)
Multiple: 5.95x
IRR: 43%

BASE CASE (Exit Year 6, $650M valuation):
Investor proceeds: $132.6M (20.4% × $650M)
Multiple: 11.05x
IRR: 62%

AGGRESSIVE (Exit Year 7, $1.2B valuation):
Investor proceeds: $244.8M (20.4% × $1.2B)
Multiple: 20.4x
IRR: 71%

Even conservative case delivers 6x return and 43% IRR - exceptional.

CAPITAL EFFICIENCY METRICS
---------------------------

YEAR 1 POST-FUNDING TARGETS:

Revenue: $12.8M (5.1x growth from $2.5M)
Customers: 48 (4x growth from 12)
ARR per dollar raised: $1.07 ($12.8M ARR / $12M raised)

Magic Number (Q4 2025): 1.5
(Every $1 of S&M spend generates $1.50 of ARR)

Gross Burn Multiple: 1.1
(Gross burn / Net new ARR - lower is better)

Months to payback per customer: 1.3 months (world-class)

RISKS AND MITIGATION
---------------------

FUNDING RISKS:

1. Execution Risk:
   What if we don't hit milestones?
   
   Mitigation:
   - Experienced team (done this before)
   - Conservative assumptions
   - Monthly board reviews
   - Quick pivots if needed

2. Market Risk:
   What if crypto bear market reduces demand?
   
   Mitigation:
   - Customers trade in all markets (volatility is good)
   - Mission-critical infrastructure (sticky)
   - 24-month runway (outlast downturn)

3. Competitive Risk:
   What if competitors match our technology?
   
   Mitigation:
   - 3-year head start difficult to close
   - Continuous innovation (25% resources on R&D)
   - Network effects (more exchanges = more valuable)

4. Team Risk:
   What if we can't hire fast enough?
   
   Mitigation:
   - Strong employer brand (team pedigree)
   - Advisor network for recruiting
   - Competitive compensation

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS:

If we only raise $8M instead of $12M:
- Focus on engineering (60%) and sales (30%)
- Delay international expansion
- 18 months to profitability instead of 18
- Still achievable, but tighter

If we raise $15M instead of $12M:
- Accelerate international expansion
- Larger sales team (8-10 AEs vs 5)
- Series B earlier (from position of strength)
- Faster path to market leadership
