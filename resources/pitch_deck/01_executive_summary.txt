One-Page Investment Overview
================================================================================

COMPANY OVERVIEW
----------------

Company Name: QuantFlow Technologies, Inc.
Founded: 2023
Headquarters: Delaware, USA (Operations: Singapore, London)
Industry: Financial Technology - Cryptocurrency Trading Infrastructure
Stage: Series A Fundraising

ELEVATOR PITCH:
QuantFlow provides institutional-grade high-frequency trading infrastructure
for cryptocurrency markets, delivering sub-millisecond latency execution across
15+ exchanges. Our platform enables quantitative trading firms, market makers,
and proprietary trading desks to capture market opportunities that exist for
only microseconds, generating consistent alpha in the $2.4 trillion daily
crypto trading market.

THE PROBLEM
-----------

MARKET INEFFICIENCY:
Cryptocurrency markets are highly fragmented across 400+ exchanges, creating
persistent arbitrage opportunities, price discrepancies, and inefficient
order execution. Traditional trading infrastructure is too slow to capture
these fleeting opportunities.

KEY PAIN POINTS:

1. LATENCY BOTTLENECKS:
   - Existing solutions: 5-50ms execution latency
   - Missed opportunities: $140M+ daily arbitrage uncaptured
   - Technology gap: Legacy systems not built for crypto speed

2. FRAGMENTED INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Manual integration: 3-6 months per exchange
   - Inconsistent APIs: Different protocols, data formats
   - Operational complexity: Multiple systems, vendors, contracts

3. HIGH COSTS:
   - Infrastructure: $500K-$2M annual costs per desk
   - Development: 5-10 engineers dedicated to trading tech
   - Opportunity cost: Slower time-to-market for new strategies

2. UNIFIED MULTI-EXCHANGE CONNECTIVITY:
   - Pre-integrated with 15 major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
   - Normalized API layer for consistent interaction
   - Real-time market data aggregation and normalization
   - Cross-exchange order routing and execution

3. INTELLIGENT RISK MANAGEMENT:
   - Real-time position tracking across all venues
   - Pre-trade risk checks (<100 microseconds)
   - Automated circuit breakers and kill switches
   - Comprehensive audit trails and compliance reporting
