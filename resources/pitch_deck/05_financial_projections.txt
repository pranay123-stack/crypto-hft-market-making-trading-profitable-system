SCENARIO ANALYSIS
-----------------

BASE CASE (presented above):
- Customer growth: 300% (Y1) → 61% (Y5)
- ACV growth: 5-7% annually
- Churn: 5-8% annually
- NDR: 142%
- 2029 Revenue: $218.4M
- 2029 EBITDA: $95.0M (44% margin)

- ACV growth: 3% annually (slower expansion)
- Churn: 10% annually (higher churn)
- NDR: 125% (vs 142%)
- Competitive pressure on pricing

Financial Results:
                                2025      2026      2027      2028      2029

RUNWAY ANALYSIS:

Pre-Series A:
  Cash balance: $1.2M
  Monthly burn: $280K
  Months of runway: 4.3 months
  Conclusion: Need funding urgently

Post-Series A:
  Cash balance (Q1 2025): $10.5M
  Q2 2025 burn: $640K
  Q3 2025 burn: $400K
  Q4 2025 burn: $235K
  Q1 2026 burn: $150K
  Q2 2026: Cash flow positive
  Runway: 24+ months to Series B or profitability
  Conclusion: Adequate runway

PROFITABILITY MILESTONES:

Metric                          Target Date       Achievement
Monthly cash flow positive      July 2026         Q3 2026
Quarterly EBITDA positive       September 2026    Q3 2026
Quarterly net income positive   December 2026     Q4 2026
Annual EBITDA positive          December 2026     FY 2026
Annual net income positive      December 2026     FY 2026

Expected timeline from Series A close: 18 months to profitability

SERIES B CONSIDERATIONS:

Will we need Series B?
- Base case: No, generate $135M cumulative FCF 2025-2029
- Conservative case: Maybe, $52M cumulative FCF (less margin for error)
- Aggressive case: Optional, could accelerate growth

If we raise Series B:
- Timing: Q2 2027 (from position of strength)
- Amount: $50M-$100M
- Valuation: $400M-$600M (based on $68M revenue, 8-10x multiple)
- Use: International expansion, M&A, enterprise sales force
- Dilution: 10-20%

Interpretation: Best-in-class metrics across the board, justifying
premium valuation multiple.

VALUATION FRAMEWORK:

Public SaaS Comparables (EV/Revenue multiples):
- Low growth (<20%): 3-6x
- Medium growth (20-40%): 6-12x
- High growth (>40%): 10-20x
- Best-in-class: 15-30x

Our expected multiple (2029, 70% growth):
- Conservative: 10x revenue = $2.18B
- Base: 12x revenue = $2.62B
- Aggressive: 15x revenue = $3.27B

Private company discount: 20-30%
Expected private valuation: $1.8B-$2.6B

INVESTOR RETURN SCENARIOS:

Series A Investment: $12M at $50M post-money (24% ownership)
Assuming 15% dilution in Series B

Exit Year 5 Valuation:       Investor Proceeds:  Multiple:  IRR:
$1.5B (conservative)         $306M               26x        92%
$2.2B (base case)            $449M               37x        108%
$3.0B (aggressive)           $612M               51x        123%

All scenarios deliver exceptional returns for investors.

FINANCIAL RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
--------------------------------

KEY FINANCIAL RISKS:

1. Revenue Concentration:
   Risk: Top 10 customers = 40% of revenue
   Mitigation: Expand customer base to 100+ by Year 2
   Target: No customer >10% of revenue

2. Burn Rate:
   Risk: Higher than expected burn depletes runway
   Mitigation: Monthly financial reviews, adjust spending
   Buffer: $1.2M contingency reserve

3. Delayed Profitability:
   Risk: Takes longer than 18 months to reach profitability
   Mitigation: Can cut discretionary spending (S&M)
   Plan B: Series B earlier if needed

4. Pricing Pressure:
   Risk: Competition forces price reductions
   Mitigation: Maintain technology advantage
   Sensitivity: 10% price cut = 12 month profitability delay

5. Customer Churn:
   Risk: Churn higher than 5-8% assumption
   Mitigation: Customer success team, product improvements
   Sensitivity: Each 1% churn = $2-3M revenue impact by Year 3

CONCLUSION
----------

Financial projections demonstrate:

1. Strong Revenue Growth: $2.5M → $218M (154% CAGR)
2. Margin Expansion: Gross 76% → 89%, EBITDA -128% → +44%
3. Path to Profitability: 18 months post-funding
4. Capital Efficiency: No Series B required
5. Strong Cash Generation: $135M cumulative FCF
6. Attractive Investor Returns: 37x multiple, 108% IRR (base case)

The financial model demonstrates a clear path to building a $200M+ revenue,
highly profitable SaaS business with exceptional unit economics and strong
competitive position.
