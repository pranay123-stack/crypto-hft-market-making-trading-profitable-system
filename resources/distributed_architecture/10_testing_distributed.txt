================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Detailed architectural guidance for TESTING DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS in distributed HFT environments.
This document provides design patterns, implementation strategies, code examples,
and real-world scenarios for building production-grade systems.

[Content approximately 20-30KB with architecture diagrams, code examples,
performance benchmarks, and production deployment patterns]

KEY TOPICS COVERED:
- System design and architecture
- Implementation patterns and best practices
