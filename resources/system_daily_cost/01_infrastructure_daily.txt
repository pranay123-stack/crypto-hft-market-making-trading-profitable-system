----------------------------------------------
    Total Daily Operational Cost: $49,342
    Infrastructure Daily Cost: $22,203
    Infrastructure %: 45.0%

This is typical for HFT operations where proximity to exchanges and
ultra-low latency are critical. Industry average: 40-50%.

COST DRIVERS & SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:
-------------------------------------

Primary Cost Drivers:
1. Proximity to exchange (colocation tier)
2. Power consumption (number of servers)
3. Network bandwidth requirements
4. Redundancy requirements (N+1, 2N, etc.)
5. Geographic distribution (multi-site)

Sensitivity:
- 10% reduction in server count → 8% infrastructure cost reduction
- Move from Tier 1 to Tier 2 colo → 25-35% colocation cost reduction
- Reduce network bandwidth by 50% → 15-20% network cost reduction
- Eliminate DR site → 35-40% infrastructure cost reduction (HIGH RISK)

This hybrid approach balances performance with cost.

POWER CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN:
----------------------------

Per-Rack Power Profile (Typical HFT Configuration):
    8× Dell PowerEdge R760 Servers: 450W each × 8 = 3,600W
    2× Arista 7280 Switches: 250W each × 2 = 500W
    1× PDU (Power Distribution Unit): 50W
    1× KVM Switch: 30W
    1× UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply): 120W (standby)
    Network Equipment: 200W
    Total per Rack: 4,500W = 4.5 kW

With redundancy and peak loads:
    Average Load: 6.5 kW per rack
    Peak Load: 9.5 kW per rack
    Contracted Capacity: 12-15 kW per rack (headroom for expansion)

Annual Power Consumption:
    20 racks × 6.5 kW average = 130 kW continuous
    130 kW × 24 hours × 365 days = 1,138,800 kWh/year

Power Cost:
    US Locations (average $0.12/kWh): 900,000 kWh × $0.12 = $108,000/year
    UK Location (£0.15/kWh): 175,200 kWh × £0.15 = £26,280/year ($33,000)
    Japan Location (¥15/kWh): 63,600 kWh × ¥15 = ¥954,000/year ($6,400)

Steady-State Annual Hardware Spending: $1,500,000 - $2,000,000

This rolling refresh maintains competitiveness while smoothing costs.

HARDWARE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------

Example: Should we upgrade to latest-gen CPUs?

Current Servers: Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 (2021)
    Performance: 100% baseline
    Power: 270W TDP
    Cost: $25,000 per server (3 years ago)

New Option: Intel Xeon Platinum 8592+ (2024)
    Performance: 140% of baseline (IPC + clock improvement)
    Power: 350W TDP
    Cost: $32,000 per server

Analysis:
    Performance Gain: +40%
    Power Increase: +30% (+80W per server)
    Cost Premium: +28% ($7,000 per server)

    Performance per Dollar: 140/32,000 = 0.004375 vs 100/25,000 = 0.004
    Improvement: +9.4% performance/dollar

    Performance per Watt: 140/350 = 0.400 vs 100/270 = 0.370
    Improvement: +8.1% performance/watt

Decision: Upgrade is marginally beneficial. Recommended for 50% of fleet
in next refresh cycle. Remaining 50% can wait for next generation.

Expected Impact:
    80 servers × $32,000 = $2,560,000 one-time cost
    Depreciated over 3 years: $853,333/year = $2,339/day
    Performance improvement: 20% overall fleet improvement
    Revenue impact: ~$40,000/day (from faster execution, less slippage)

ROI: 40,000 / 2,339 = 17.1x daily return
Payback Period: 64 days

UPGRADE IS JUSTIFIED.

COOLING COSTS:
--------------

Cooling Requirements:
    Heat Dissipation: 120 kW IT load → 409,200 BTU/hour
    Cooling Capacity Required: 35 tons (1 ton = 12,000 BTU/hour)

Cooling Options:
1. Air Cooling (CRAC units): $2,500/month per 10 tons = $8,750/month
2. Liquid Cooling (In-Row): $4,000/month per 10 tons = $14,000/month
3. Immersion Cooling: $6,000/month per 10 tons = $21,000/month

We use Air Cooling (CRAC): $8,750/month = $288/day

Cooling Cost as % of Power Cost: 288 / 567 = 50.8%
This is captured in PUE of 1.5 above.

POWER OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
---------------------------------

| TOTAL DR         |              |               | $105,000 |
+------------------+--------------+---------------+----------+

Daily DR Cost: $3,454

DR Cost as % of Total Infrastructure: 3,454 / 22,203 = 15.6%

COST JUSTIFICATION:
-------------------

Estimated Revenue Loss from Datacenter Outage:
    Average Daily Revenue: $200,000
    Outage Duration (without DR): 4-24 hours
    Revenue Loss: $33,000 - $200,000 per outage

    Historical Outage Frequency: 0.5 events per year
    Expected Annual Loss without DR: $100,000 - $150,000

    DR Annual Cost: $1,260,000
    Benefit: Business continuity, regulatory compliance, reputation

While DR doesn't fully "pay for itself" in pure financial terms, it's
essential for:
1. Regulatory requirements (SEC, CFTC, FCA, FSA)
2. Client commitments (SLAs)
3. Reputation management (can't afford prolonged outages)
4. Risk management (protect against catastrophic losses)

DR FAILOVER CAPABILITIES:
-------------------------

RTO (Recovery Time Objective): 15 minutes
RPO (Recovery Point Objective): 0 seconds (synchronous replication)

Failover Process:
1. Primary site failure detected (automatic, <10 seconds)
2. DNS/routing updated to DR site (30 seconds)
3. Trading systems activated at DR site (2-5 minutes)
4. Operator verification and manual go-live (10 minutes)
5. Total RTO: 15 minutes

During failover:
- Market making strategies paused (liquidity provision stops)
- Arbitrage strategies continue (critical for hedging)
- Risk management systems fully operational

Estimated Revenue Impact during Failover:
    15 minutes downtime = 1.04% of trading day
    Revenue Impact: $200,000 × 1.04% = $2,083 per failover

Acceptable cost for business continuity.

DATA REPLICATION COSTS:
-----------------------

Synchronous Replication (NY5 → NY4):
    Bandwidth: 10 Gbps dedicated fiber
    Latency: <500 microseconds
    Cost: $12,000/month = $395/day

Asynchronous Replication (CH1 → CH2):
    Bandwidth: 1 Gbps
    Latency: <2 milliseconds (acceptable for async)
    Cost: $4,000/month = $132/day

Total Replication Cost: $527/day

                    8. COST CALCULATION EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: DAILY INFRASTRUCTURE COST FOR A SINGLE STRATEGY
-----------------------------------------------------------

Strategy: Market Making on SPY (S&P 500 ETF)

Resources Allocated:
- Compute: 4 servers (2.5% of total fleet)
- Network: 2 DMA connections (NYSE, Arca)
- Colocation: 0.2 racks (1% of total)
- Market Data: Separate allocation (see data_costs.txt)

Cost Allocation:

1. Compute (Proportional to server count):
   Total Server Cost: $4,934/day depreciation + $405/day power
   Strategy Allocation: 4/160 = 2.5%
   Strategy Compute Cost: $5,339 × 2.5% = $133/day

2. Network (Direct allocation):
   NYSE DMA: $493/day
   Arca DMA: Included with NYSE (same Archipelago network)
   Strategy Network Cost: $493/day

3. Colocation (Proportional to rack space):
   Total Colo Cost: $9,868/day
   Strategy Allocation: 1%
   Strategy Colo Cost: $9,868 × 1% = $99/day

4. Shared Infrastructure (Allocated equally across strategies):
   We run 20 strategies, shared costs = $7,401 network overhead
   Per-Strategy: $7,401 / 20 = $370/day

Total Strategy Infrastructure Cost: $133 + $493 + $99 + $370 = $1,095/day

Strategy Performance:
    Daily Revenue: $42,000
    Infrastructure Cost: $1,095
    Trading Costs: $8,200 (see trading_costs.txt)
    Data Costs: $1,800 (see data_costs.txt)
    Total Costs: $11,095
    Net Profit: $30,905

    Cost Ratio: 26.4% (acceptable for market making)

EXAMPLE 2: CALCULATING COST OF ADDING A NEW MARKET
---------------------------------------------------

   Power (0.5 racks @ 6.5kW): Included in colocation
   LSE DMA (10 GbE): $8,000/month
   Cross-connects (4): £250 × 4 = £1,000/month = $1,300/month
   Total Monthly: $13,200/month

3. Daily Recurring:
   Monthly / 30.4 = $434/day

4. Depreciation:
   Hardware $320,000 / 3 years = $106,667/year = $292/day

Total Daily Cost for New Market: $434 + $292 = $726/day

Break-Even Analysis:
    Required Daily Revenue: $726 / 0.25 (target 25% cost ratio) = $2,904
    Required Net Profit: $2,904 - $726 = $2,178/day

Is this achievable? Market research needed:
- FTSE 100 average daily volume: £5.2 billion
- Our expected market share: 0.5%
- Our expected volume: £26 million = $33.8 million
- Expected profit margin: 0.01% (1 basis point)

2. Infrastructure Costs Continue:
   Hourly Infrastructure Cost: $22,203 / 24 = $926
   1 Hour Cost: $926 (still incurred, no trading)

3. Recovery Costs:
   Emergency failover to DR site: $5,000 (smart hands, emergency support)
   Failback to primary site: $3,000
   Total Recovery Costs: $8,000

4. Opportunity Cost:
   Missed arbitrage opportunities: Estimated $10,000 - $20,000
   Market making obligations not met: Potential fines $5,000

Total Cost of 1-Hour Outage: $30,769 + $926 + $8,000 + $15,000 = $54,695

Annual Outage Budget:
    Expected Outages per Year: 2 events (99.9% uptime)
    Expected Duration: 30 minutes average
    Expected Annual Outage Cost: $54,695 × 0.5 hours × 2 = $54,695/year

Target State: Servers scale power based on trading activity

Expected Power Savings:
- Pre-market (6-9:30 AM): 40% power reduction
- Trading hours (9:30 AM-4 PM): 0% reduction (full power)
- After-hours (4 PM-6 PM): 30% power reduction
- Overnight (6 PM-6 AM): 60% power reduction

Weighted Average Power Savings:
    (3.5 hrs × 40%) + (6.5 hrs × 0%) + (2 hrs × 30%) + (12 hrs × 60%) / 24
    = (1.4 + 0 + 0.6 + 7.2) / 24 = 38.3% average savings

Current Power Cost: $567/day
Savings: $567 × 38.3% = $217/day
Annual Savings: $79,205/year

Implementation Cost:
- Software/firmware updates: $50,000
- Testing and validation: $30,000
- Total: $80,000

- DR hot standby: $3,454/day
- Dev/Test: 10 servers = $2,320/day
Total: $10,578/day

Cloud Alternative Cost:
- Research compute: 20× c6i.8xlarge reserved = $2,400/day
- Storage: 200TB S3 Glacier = $800/month = $26/day
- DR warm standby: 50% capacity on-demand = $1,200/day
- Dev/Test: Spot instances = $400/day
Total: $4,026/day

Potential Savings: $10,578 - $4,026 = $6,552/day
Annual Savings: $2,391,480/year

Migration Risks:
- Data transfer costs (initial migration)
- Ongoing data egress costs
- Latency for data access
- Security and compliance considerations

Net Savings (after factoring in data transfer):
    Estimated Annual Savings: $1,800,000/year = $4,932/day

This is the SINGLE LARGEST optimization opportunity identified.

RECOMMENDATION: High priority for 2026 roadmap.

CONSOLIDATED OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP:
-----------------------------------

Priority 1 (Immediate - Q4 2025):
- Audit and disconnect unused cross-connects
  Savings: $198/day = $72,270/year

Priority 2 (Q1 2026):
- Implement intelligent power management
  Savings: $217/day = $79,205/year
- Renegotiate CME DMA pricing
  Savings: $99/day = $36,000/year

Priority 3 (Q2 2026):
- Migrate non-critical workloads to cloud
  Savings: $4,932/day = $1,800,000/year
- Server consolidation (phase 1)
  Savings: $839/day = $306,235/year

Priority 4 (Q3-Q4 2026):
- Renegotiate all network contracts
  Savings: $1,048/day = $382,520/year
- Complete server consolidation (phase 2)
  Additional savings: $839/day = $306,235/year

TOTAL ANNUAL SAVINGS TARGET: $2,982,465/year

Impact on Daily Infrastructure Costs:
    Current: $22,203/day
    After Optimizations: $22,203 - $8,172 = $14,031/day
    Reduction: 36.8%

This would improve our cost ratio from 22.5% to 16.2%, achieving
industry-leading efficiency.
