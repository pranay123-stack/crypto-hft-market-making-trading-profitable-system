================================================================================
                  6. STRATEGY COMBINATION GUIDELINES
================================================================================

6.1 DIVERSIFICATION PRINCIPLES
------------------------------

PRINCIPLE 1: UNCORRELATED APPROACHES
------------------------------------
Combine strategies with low correlation:

Good Combinations:
+ Momentum + Mean Reversion
  (One profits from trends, other from reversals)

+ Market Making + Statistical Arbitrage
  (Different risk profiles and profit drivers)

+ Event-Driven + Market Making
  (Different time horizons and triggers)

Poor Combinations:
- Multiple Momentum strategies
  (All fail in range-bound markets)

- Multiple Mean Reversion strategies
  (All fail when trends form)

PRINCIPLE 2: DIVERSIFY ACROSS DIMENSIONS
----------------------------------------
Diversify across:

1. Trading Approach:
   - Directional + Market Neutral
   - Liquidity Provision + Liquidity Taking

2. Time Horizon:
   - Short-term + Medium-term
   - Intraday + Multi-day

3. Market Regimes:
   - Trending + Range-bound
   - High Vol + Low Vol

4. Instruments:
   - Different sectors
   - Different asset classes
   - Different exchanges

5. Risk Factors:
   - Different risk drivers
   - Different failure modes

PRINCIPLE 3: PORTFOLIO RESILIENCE
---------------------------------
Build portfolio that:
- Performs reasonably in various market conditions
- Doesn't have single points of failure
- Limits maximum loss scenarios
- Provides consistent returns

Test portfolio under:
- 2008-style crisis
- Flash crash
- Prolonged sideways market
- Strong bull market
- Strong bear market

6.2 CORRELATION MANAGEMENT
--------------------------

MEASURE CORRELATION:

Daily P&L Correlation:
Calculate correlation between strategies' daily P&L

Target Correlation Matrix:
Strategy 1  Strategy 2  Strategy 3
   1.0        0.3        -0.1     Strategy 1
              1.0         0.2     Strategy 2
                         1.0      Strategy 3

Goals:
- Positive but moderate correlations acceptable (< 0.5)
- Negative correlations excellent (hedging effect)
- Very high correlations (> 0.7) indicate redundancy

MANAGE CORRELATION:

If correlation too high:
- Reduce allocation to redundant strategies
- Find more differentiated approaches
- Adjust parameters to reduce overlap

Benefits of Low Correlation:
- Smoother equity curve
- Better risk-adjusted returns
- More consistent performance
- Lower maximum drawdown

6.3 RISK BALANCING
-----------------

ALLOCATE RISK, NOT JUST CAPITAL:

Risk Parity Approach:
- Each strategy contributes equally to portfolio risk
- Volatile strategies get less capital
- Stable strategies get more capital

Example:
Strategy A: High vol, gets $1M (10% of capital)
Strategy B: Medium vol, gets $3M (30% of capital)
Strategy C: Low vol, gets $6M (60% of capital)

Result: Each contributes ~33% of portfolio volatility

Risk Budget:
Total acceptable portfolio volatility: X%
Allocate to strategies such that:
  Portfolio Vol = sqrt(Σ wi²σi² + 2Σ Σ wiwjσiσjρij) ≤ X%

where:
  wi = weight of strategy i
  σi = volatility of strategy i
  ρij = correlation between strategies i and j

MONITOR RISK CONTRIBUTION:

Track:
- Each strategy's volatility
- Each strategy's contribution to portfolio vol
- Changes over time
- Rebalance as needed

6.4 CAPACITY ALLOCATION
-----------------------

ALLOCATE CAPACITY EFFICIENTLY:

High Capacity Strategies:
- Can handle large capital allocations
- Scale well
- Typically lower returns per dollar

Low Capacity Strategies:
- Limited capital before performance degrades
- Often higher returns per dollar
- Fill first in priority order

Allocation Approach:
1. Identify each strategy's capacity
2. Rank by expected risk-adjusted return
3. Allocate up to capacity in rank order
4. Subject to diversification requirements

Example:
Strategy A: Capacity $2M, Sharpe 2.5 → Fully allocate
Strategy B: Capacity $10M, Sharpe 2.0 → Partially allocate
Strategy C: Capacity $5M, Sharpe 1.5 → Smaller allocation
Strategy D: Capacity $20M, Sharpe 1.2 → Remainder

6.5 PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION
--------------------------

STEP-BY-STEP PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION:

STEP 1: DEFINE CONSTRAINTS
- Total capital available
- Maximum positions at once
- Risk tolerance (max drawdown, VaR)
- Operational constraints

STEP 2: SELECT STRATEGY POOL
- Choose 3-5 strategies (typical)
- Ensure diversification
- Match to trader profile
- Verify operational feasibility

STEP 3: ESTIMATE PARAMETERS
For each strategy:
- Expected return
- Expected volatility
- Capacity
- Correlation with others

STEP 4: OPTIMIZE ALLOCATION
Use mean-variance optimization or risk parity
Subject to constraints
Allocate capital

STEP 5: BACK-TEST PORTFOLIO
- Simulate historical performance
- Check drawdowns acceptable
- Verify diversification working
- Stress test

STEP 6: IMPLEMENT GRADUALLY
- Start with reduced allocations
- Scale up over time
- Monitor and adjust
- Rebalance periodically

EXAMPLE PORTFOLIO:

Trader Profile: Experienced, Moderate Risk Tolerance, $5M Capital

Selected Strategies:
1. Adaptive Market Making - $2M (40%)
2. Statistical Arbitrage - $1.5M (30%)
3. Mean Reversion - $1M (20%)
4. Short-term Momentum - $0.5M (10%)

Expected Portfolio Sharpe: 2.0
Expected Max Drawdown: 12%
Diversification: Good (correlations 0.2 - 0.4)

+ Position Trading

Acceptable:
o Market Making (steady trends, manageable)

Poor:
- Mean Reversion (trends persist)
- Range Trading

Strategy Adjustments:
- Can use normal parameters
- Let winners run longer
- Trail stops effectively

REGIME 3: RANGING + HIGH VOLATILITY
-----------------------------------
Challenging Regime (Hardest to Trade):

Acceptable:

Poor:
- Momentum (no trends)
- Breakout (false breakouts)

Strategy Adjustments:

- Tighter stops viable
- Frequent trading
- Maximize capacity

MIXED/TRANSITIONAL REGIMES:
---------------------------
During regime transitions:
- Reduce risk across all strategies
- Be cautious with new positions
- Wait for clarity
- Preserve capital

7.3 ADAPTIVE STRATEGY SELECTION
-------------------------------

DYNAMIC STRATEGY WEIGHTING:

Approach: Adjust strategy allocations based on current regime

Implementation:
1. Identify current regime (daily or weekly)
2. Increase allocation to favored strategies
3. Decrease allocation to unfavored strategies
4. Rebalance regularly

Example:
Current Regime: Ranging + Low Volatility

Adjustments:
- Mean Reversion: 100% allocation → Emphasize
- Market Making: 100% allocation → Emphasize
- Momentum: 100% → 50% allocation → Reduce
- Statistical Arb: 100% allocation → Maintain

REGIME FORECASTING:

Leading Indicators:
- Central bank policies
- Economic data trends
- Volatility futures term structure
- Market breadth indicators

Use forecasts to:
- Position ahead of regime changes
- Prepare strategy mix adjustments
- Manage risk proactively

ADAPTIVE RULES:

Rule 1: IF VIX > 25 AND ADX < 20 (Ranging High Vol)
       THEN Reduce all allocations to 50%

Rule 2: IF VIX < 15 AND ADX < 20 (Ranging Low Vol)
       THEN Emphasize Mean Reversion and Market Making

Rule 3: IF ADX > 25 (Strong Trend)
       THEN Emphasize Momentum, Reduce Mean Reversion

Rule 4: IF Regime uncertain
       THEN Balanced allocation, moderate risk

7.4 SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------

SEASONAL PATTERNS:

JANUARY EFFECT:
- Typically higher volatility
- Seasonal flows
- Strategies: Be ready for vol expansion

SUMMER DOLDRUMS (June-August):
- Often lower volume and volatility
- Many traders on vacation
- Strategies: Mean reversion, market making work well
- Caution: Can have sudden spikes

SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER:
- Historically volatile months
- Crash risk historically higher
- Strategies: Be cautious, reduce risk

YEAR-END (November-December):
- Window dressing flows
- Tax-loss selling
- Holiday trading (low volume)
- Strategies: Adapt to low liquidity

QUARTER-ENDS:
- Index rebalancing
- Window dressing
- Can have volatility
- Strategies: Be aware of flows

EXPIRATION WEEKS:

- Strategies: Be cautious, understand expiration dynamics

ECONOMIC CALENDAR:
- Major data releases (NFP, CPI, FOMC)
- Plan around these
- Adjust risk accordingly
- Some strategies stop, others embrace vol
