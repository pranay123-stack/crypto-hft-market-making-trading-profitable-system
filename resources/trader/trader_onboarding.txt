You're embarking on an exciting journey. Trading is challenging, rewarding,
demanding, and intellectually stimulating.

This 16-week program is intensive, but it works. We've refined it over years.
Alumni of this program are now successful traders across the firm.

Success requires:
- Hard work and dedication
- Intellectual curiosity
- Emotional discipline
- Risk management focus
- Ethical behavior
- Continuous learning

We're committed to your development. We're investing heavily in you because
we believe in your potential.

In return, we ask for:
- Your best effort every day
- Receptiveness to feedback
- Adherence to our standards
- Long-term commitment
- Contribution to our team

Not everyone succeeds in trading. That's OK. We'll be honest with you, and
we expect honesty from you. If it's not the right fit, we'll figure that
out together and find a better path.

For those who do succeed, you'll join an elite community of traders. You'll
have a rewarding career, continuous growth opportunities, and the satisfaction
of performing at the highest levels in one of the most competitive fields.

We're excited to work with you. Let's begin!
