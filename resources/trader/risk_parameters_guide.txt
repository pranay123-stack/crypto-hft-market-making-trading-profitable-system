================================================================================

1.1 PURPOSE AND IMPORTANCE
--------------------------
Risk parameters are the guardrails that prevent catastrophic losses while
allowing traders to pursue profitable opportunities. Properly set risk limits:

PROTECT THE FIRM:
- Prevent losses that threaten firm viability
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Maintain reputation and trust
- Protect client capital

PROTECT THE TRADER:
- Prevent career-ending losses
- Manage psychological stress
- Enable sustainable trading
- Build confidence through defined boundaries

OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE:
- Focus trading on highest-quality opportunities
- Prevent overtrading and excessive risk-taking
- Encourage disciplined decision-making
- Support long-term success

Key Principle:
"The first rule of trading is don't lose money. The second rule is don't
forget the first rule." - Warren Buffett

Risk limits exist to enforce this principle systematically.

1.2 RISK MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY
------------------------------
Our risk management approach is based on these core tenets:

PRESERVATION FIRST:
- Capital preservation is paramount
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Live to trade another day
- Compounding requires capital protection

QUANTITATIVE AND SYSTEMATIC:
- Risk limits should be quantifiable
- Systematically enforced
- Not subject to discretion or emotion
- Technology-enabled monitoring

MULTI-LAYERED DEFENSE:
- Multiple levels of risk controls
- Redundant safeguards
- Pre-trade, intra-day, and post-trade checks
- Fail-safe mechanisms

ADAPTIVE BUT DISCIPLINED:
- Limits should adapt to changing conditions
- But changes follow process and approval
- Never override limits in heat of moment
- Document all limit modifications

ALIGNED INCENTIVES:
- Trader incentives aligned with risk management
- Compensation considers risk-adjusted returns
- Breaches have consequences
- Good risk management rewarded

1.3 REGULATORY CONTEXT
----------------------
Risk limits must comply with:

SEC REGULATIONS:
- Rule 15c3-5 (Market Access Rule)
- Risk management controls required
- Pre-trade risk checks mandatory
- Documentation and testing required

FINRA RULES:
- Rule 3110 (Supervision)
- Risk management procedures
- Regular review required

EXCHANGE RULES:
- Exchange-specific risk limits
- Erroneous trade prevention
- Price limits and circuit breakers

FIRM POLICIES:
- Internal risk framework
- Board-approved risk appetite
- Risk committee oversight
- Compliance requirements

BEST PRACTICES:
- Industry standards
- Peer benchmarking
- Evolving market standards
- Lessons from incidents

Our risk parameters are designed to exceed minimum regulatory requirements
and align with industry best practices.

================================================================================
                    2. RISK PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

2.1 POSITION LIMITS
-------------------

DEFINITION:
Maximum size of positions that can be held, specified in various ways:

BY DOLLAR VALUE:
Example: Maximum $2M position in any single symbol
- Easy to understand
- Directly relates to risk capital
- Must be marked-to-market continuously

BY SHARES/CONTRACTS:
Example: Maximum 50,000 shares of any stock
- Clear and simple
- Must consider price differences across symbols
- Less useful for comparing risk across instruments

BY PERCENTAGE OF ADV (Average Daily Volume):
Example: Maximum 5% of ADV
- Relates to liquidity
- Ensures exit capability
- Must recalculate as ADV changes

BY VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED:
Example: Maximum position such that 1-day 2-std-dev move = $50K
- Risk-adjusted
- More sophisticated
- Automatically adjusts to volatility

TYPICAL HIERARCHY:
- Per-symbol limit (most granular)
- Per-strategy limit (group of positions)
- Per-sector limit (concentration control)
- Total portfolio limit (overall exposure)

2.2 LOSS LIMITS
---------------

DEFINITION:
Maximum allowable losses over specified time periods

DAILY LOSS LIMIT:
- Maximum loss in single trading day
- Most critical limit
- Typical range: 1-3% of capital
- Auto-stop when reached

Example: -$50,000 daily loss limit on $5M capital (1%)

WEEKLY LOSS LIMIT:
- Maximum loss over rolling 7-day period
- Typically 2-4x daily limit
- Allows recovery time

Example: -$150,000 weekly loss limit (3% of capital)

MONTHLY LOSS LIMIT:
- Maximum loss in calendar month
- Typically 5-10% of capital
- Strategic review trigger

Example: -$300,000 monthly loss limit (6% of capital)

MAXIMUM DRAWDOWN LIMIT:
- Maximum peak-to-trough decline
- Can be from all-time high or period high
- Typically 10-25% depending on risk tolerance

Example: 15% maximum drawdown from high-water mark

SINGLE TRADE LOSS LIMIT:
- Maximum loss on any single trade
- Enforced by stop-losses
- Typically 0.1-0.5% of capital per trade

Example: -$5,000 maximum loss per trade

2.3 LEVERAGE LIMITS
-------------------

DEFINITION:
Maximum ratio of total exposure to capital

LEVERAGE CALCULATION:
Leverage = Total Gross Exposure / Capital

Example:
Long positions: $8M
Short positions: $6M
Total Gross Exposure: $14M
Capital: $5M
Leverage: 14/5 = 2.8x

TYPICAL LIMITS BY EXPERIENCE:

New Trader: 1.5x - 2.0x
- Conservative until proven
- Build experience gradually

Junior Trader: 2.0x - 3.0x
- Moderate leverage
- Track record established

Experienced Trader: 3.0x - 5.0x
- Higher leverage allowed
- Proven risk management

Senior Trader: 5.0x - 10.0x
- Maximum leverage
- Exceptional track record required
- Subject to additional oversight

STRATEGY-SPECIFIC:
- Market Making: Often higher leverage (5-10x) due to offsetting positions
- Directional: Lower leverage (1-3x) due to unhedged risk
- Statistical Arbitrage: Moderate leverage (2-5x)

2.4 CONCENTRATION LIMITS
------------------------

DEFINITION:
Limits on how much risk can be concentrated in single positions, sectors,
or factors

SINGLE POSITION CONCENTRATION:
- Maximum % of portfolio in single position
- Typical limit: 20-40%

Example: No single position > 30% of total portfolio value

SECTOR CONCENTRATION:
- Maximum % in single sector
- Prevents sector-specific risk
- Typical limit: 30-50%

Example: No more than 40% of capital in Technology sector

CORRELATED POSITION CONCENTRATION:
- Limit on highly correlated positions
- Measured by correlation matrix
- Prevents pseudo-diversification

Example: Sum of positions with correlation > 0.7 limited to 50%

FACTOR CONCENTRATION:
- Limits on exposure to risk factors
- Examples: Value, momentum, size, volatility
- Ensures factor diversification

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION:
- Limits by country or region
- For multi-market traders

2.5 EXPOSURE LIMITS
-------------------

DEFINITION:
Limits on total market exposure

GROSS EXPOSURE:
Sum of absolute values of all positions
= |Long Positions| + |Short Positions|

Example:
Longs: $6M
Shorts: $4M
Gross Exposure: $10M
Limit: $12M (OK)

NET EXPOSURE:
Net directional exposure
= Long Positions - Short Positions

Example:
Longs: $6M
Shorts: $4M
Net Exposure: +$2M (net long)
Limit: ±$3M (OK)

SECTOR EXPOSURE:
Net exposure by sector
Separate limits for each sector

TIME-WEIGHTED EXPOSURE:
Average exposure over time period
Prevents gaming by reducing just at measurement time

2.6 VOLATILITY LIMITS
---------------------

DEFINITION:
Limits based on portfolio volatility

PORTFOLIO VOLATILITY LIMIT:
Maximum annualized volatility of portfolio
Typical target: 10-20% annualized

Calculation:
Daily returns std dev × √252 = Annualized volatility

VALUE AT RISK (VaR):
Maximum expected loss at confidence level
Typical: 95% or 99% VaR

Example: 1-day 95% VaR = $75,000
Interpretation: 95% confident losses won't exceed $75K in one day

VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED POSITION SIZING:
Positions sized inversely to volatility
High vol instruments → Smaller positions
Low vol instruments → Larger positions

Formula:
Position Size = Target Risk / (Price × Volatility)

3.3 MARKET CONDITION FACTORS
----------------------------

Adjust limits based on market conditions:

NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS:
- Standard limits apply
- No special adjustments needed

LOW VOLATILITY (VIX < 15):
- Can slightly increase limits (+10-20%)
- Rationale: Lower risk per dollar
- More predictable environment
- Still maintain discipline

Example Adjustment:
Normal Daily Loss Limit: -$50K
Low Vol Adjustment: -$55K (+10%)

HIGH VOLATILITY (VIX 20-30):
- Reduce limits (-20-30%)
- Rationale: Higher risk per dollar
- Less predictable
- Larger moves possible

Example Adjustment:
Normal Daily Loss Limit: -$50K
High Vol Adjustment: -$35K (-30%)

EXTREME VOLATILITY (VIX > 30):
- Significantly reduce limits (-40-60%)
- Or stop trading entirely
- Extremely unpredictable
- Preservation mode

Example Adjustment:
Normal Daily Loss Limit: -$50K
Extreme Vol Adjustment: -$25K (-50%)
Or: Stop trading until VIX < 25

MARKET STRESS (Crisis Conditions):
- Minimal limits or flat
- Capital preservation only
- Wait for clarity
- Firm-wide protocols likely in effect

LOW LIQUIDITY PERIODS:
- Summer doldrums
- Holidays
- Reduce position limits
- Harder to exit

HIGH CORRELATION PERIODS:
- Diversification less effective
- Reduce overall exposure
- Increase margin of safety

3.4 FIRM-WIDE CONSTRAINTS
-------------------------

Individual limits must fit within firm parameters:

FIRM CAPITAL ALLOCATION:
- Your capital allocation from firm
- Cannot exceed allocated amount
- Affects all your limits

AGGREGATE FIRM LIMITS:
- Firm-wide exposure limits
- Per-symbol limits at firm level
- Regulatory capital requirements
- Your share of firm limits

REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS:
- Position limit rules
- Reporting thresholds
- Large trader reporting
- Exchange limits

RISK APPETITE:
- Board-approved risk appetite
- Firm risk culture
- Recent firm performance
- External pressures

CORRELATION WITH OTHER TRADERS:
- If many traders have similar positions
- Firm concentration risk
- May require individual reductions

3.5 CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES
-----------------------------

CAPITAL BASE:

Start with allocated capital:
Example: $5,000,000 allocated

DAILY LOSS LIMIT CALCULATION:

Method 1: Percentage of Capital
- Choose percentage (0.5% - 3%)
- Multiply by capital

Example: 1% × $5M = $50,000 daily loss limit

Method 2: Multiple of Average Daily Profit
- If average daily profit = $15K
- Use 3-4x multiple
- 3.5 × $15K = $52,500 daily loss limit

Method 3: Standard Deviation Method
- Calculate daily P&L standard deviation
- Use multiple of std dev (2-3x)
- If daily std dev = $18K
- 2.5 × $18K = $45,000 daily loss limit

Recommended: Use multiple methods, take conservative

POSITION LIMIT CALCULATION:

Method 1: Percentage of Capital
- 20-30% per position typical
- $5M × 25% = $1,250,000 per position

Method 2: Percentage of Portfolio Risk
- If portfolio risk budget = $100K per day
- Allocate across positions
- Per position risk = $10K-$20K
- Size accordingly

Method 3: Volatility-Adjusted
- Target risk per position (e.g., $10K for 1-day 2-std-dev move)
- Position Size = Risk Target / (Price × Vol × 2)
- Adjusts automatically to volatility

LEVERAGE LIMIT CALCULATION:

Based on:
- Typical strategy leverage
- Trader experience
- Historical performance
- Market conditions

Example:
New trader, market making strategy
- Strategy typical leverage: 5x
- New trader factor: 0.5
- Market conditions factor: 1.0
- Limit: 5 × 0.5 × 1.0 = 2.5x

CONCENTRATION LIMIT:

Single Position:
- Max 30% of portfolio

Sector:
- Max 40% of portfolio

Correlated Positions (ρ > 0.7):
- Max 50% of portfolio

Factor Exposure:
- Max 2.0 exposure to any single factor

================================================================================
                         4. POSITION LIMITS
================================================================================

4.1 PER-SYMBOL POSITION LIMITS
------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Limit exposure to any single instrument

SETTING THE LIMIT:

Consider:
1. Symbol liquidity
2. Volatility
3. Your capital
4. Strategy requirements

LIQUIDITY-BASED:
Limit = 5% of Average Daily Volume (ADV)

Example:
Stock ADV = 5,000,000 shares
Your limit = 250,000 shares
At $50/share = $12.5M potential position

May be too large for your capital, so also apply:

CAPITAL-BASED:
Limit = 25% of your capital

Example:
Your capital = $5M
Your limit = $1.25M
At $50/share = 25,000 shares

Use lesser of liquidity-based and capital-based

VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED:
Adjust for volatility

Higher vol stock → Smaller position
Lower vol stock → Larger position

Formula:
Adjusted Limit = Base Limit × (Target Vol / Stock Vol)

Example:
Base Limit = $1M
Target Vol = 20%
Stock A Vol = 30%
Adjusted Limit = $1M × (20/30) = $667K

Stock B Vol = 15%
Adjusted Limit = $1M × (20/15) = $1.33M

4.2 PER-STRATEGY POSITION LIMITS
--------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Limit total exposure per strategy

CALCULATION:
Based on strategy allocation

Example:
Total Capital: $5M

Strategy Allocation:
- Market Making: 40% = $2M
- Stat Arb: 30% = $1.5M
- Mean Reversion: 20% = $1M
- Momentum: 10% = $500K

Gross Position Limits by Strategy:
- Market Making: $2M × 5 (leverage) = $10M gross
- Stat Arb: $1.5M × 3 (leverage) = $4.5M gross
- Mean Reversion: $1M × 2 (leverage) = $2M gross
- Momentum: $500K × 2 (leverage) = $1M gross

Net Position Limits by Strategy:
- Market Making: $2M × 0.5 = $1M net
- Stat Arb: $1.5M × 0.2 = $300K net
- Mean Reversion: $1M × 0.6 = $600K net
- Momentum: $500K × 1 = $500K net

4.3 AGGREGATE POSITION LIMITS
-----------------------------

PURPOSE:
Limit total exposure across all strategies

GROSS EXPOSURE LIMIT:
Sum of all absolute position values

Example:
Capital: $5M
Gross Limit: 3x = $15M

Current Positions:
Strategy A: $6M long, $4M short = $10M gross
Strategy B: $2M long, $1M short = $3M gross
Total Gross: $13M (within $15M limit ✓)

NET EXPOSURE LIMIT:
Net long or short exposure

Example:
Capital: $5M
Net Limit: ±$2.5M (50%)

Current Positions:
Strategy A: $6M long, $4M short = $2M net long
Strategy B: $2M long, $1M short = $1M net long
Total Net: $3M net long (exceeds $2.5M limit ✗)

Action: Reduce net exposure by $500K

4.4 SECTOR AND INDUSTRY LIMITS
------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Prevent concentration in single sector/industry

SECTOR CLASSIFICATION:
Use standard classification (e.g., GICS)
- Technology
- Healthcare
- Financial
- Industrial
- Consumer
- Energy
- Materials
- Utilities
- Real Estate
- Telecom

LIMIT SETTING:
Typical: 40% max in any sector

Example:
Capital: $5M
Sector Limit: 40% = $2M

Current Exposure:
- Technology: $1.8M (36% - OK)
- Healthcare: $1.5M (30% - OK)
- Financial: $1.0M (20% - OK)
- Other: $700K (14% - OK)

INDUSTRY LIMITS:
More granular than sector

Example:
Within Technology (40% = $2M sector limit):
- Semiconductors: Max $800K (40% of sector)
- Software: Max $800K
- Hardware: Max $800K

CORRELATED SECTOR MANAGEMENT:
Some sectors move together
Example: Banks and REITs often correlated
Consider combined limit

4.5 DYNAMIC POSITION SIZING
---------------------------

CONCEPT:
Position sizes adjust dynamically based on conditions

VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED SIZING:

Formula:
Position Size = Target Risk / (Price × Volatility × Confidence Interval)

Example:
Target Risk = $10,000 per position
Price = $100
Current Vol = 30% annual = 1.9% daily
Confidence = 2 standard deviations

Position Size = $10,000 / ($100 × 0.019 × 2)
            = $10,000 / $3.80
            = 2,632 shares
            = $263,200 position

If volatility doubles to 60%:
Position Size = $10,000 / ($100 × 0.038 × 2)
            = $10,000 / $7.60
            = 1,316 shares
            = $131,600 position

Position automatically halves when vol doubles

SIGNAL-STRENGTH ADJUSTED:

Scale position size with signal confidence

Example:
Max Position Size = $1M
Signal Strength = 0.7 (on 0-1 scale)
Actual Position = $1M × 0.7 = $700K

PORTFOLIO HEAT ADJUSTED:

Reduce sizing as portfolio heat increases

Portfolio Heat = Sum of position risks / Capital

Example:
Capital = $5M
Current position risks sum to $80K
Portfolio Heat = 80/5000 = 1.6%

If heat < 1%: Normal sizing
If heat 1-2%: Reduce sizing by 20%
If heat 2-3%: Reduce sizing by 40%
If heat > 3%: Reduce sizing by 60%

PERFORMANCE-ADJUSTED:

Adjust based on recent performance

If on winning streak: Slightly increase (max +20%)
If on losing streak: Decrease (-20% to -50%)
If in drawdown > 10%: Decrease significantly (-50%)

Example:
Base Position Limit = $1M
Recent Sharpe = 2.5 (strong) → +10% = $1.1M
In 5% drawdown → -20% = $880K
Net Adjustment = $1.1M × 0.8 = $880K

================================================================================
                           5. LOSS LIMITS
================================================================================

5.1 DAILY LOSS LIMITS
---------------------

PURPOSE:
Prevent catastrophic single-day losses

SETTING THE LIMIT:

CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
0.5-1.0% of capital

Example: $5M capital × 1% = $50,000 daily limit

MODERATE APPROACH:
1.0-1.5% of capital

Example: $5M capital × 1.25% = $62,500 daily limit

AGGRESSIVE APPROACH:
1.5-2.5% of capital

Example: $5M capital × 2% = $100,000 daily limit

RECOMMENDATION:
Start conservative, increase if:
- Track record strong
- Consistent performance
- Sharpe ratio > 2.0
- Risk management proven

ENFORCEMENT:

SOFT LIMIT (Warning):
At 70-80% of limit
- Alert trader
- Enhanced monitoring
- Caution on new trades

Example: Soft limit at -$35K (-70% of $50K limit)

HARD LIMIT (Auto-Stop):
At 100% of limit
- Automatic trading halt
- Close all positions or stop new entries
- Management notification
- Cannot resume without approval

Example: Hard limit at -$50K

IMPLEMENTATION:

Real-time P&L tracking:
- Mark-to-market continuously
- Include realized and unrealized
- Alert systems active
- Dashboard display prominent

What happens at hard limit:
1. System stops all new orders
2. Notification sent to trader
3. Notification sent to risk manager
4. Notification sent to trading desk manager
5. Trader must close positions or hold overnight
6. Must complete incident report
7. Meeting with management required
8. Cannot resume next day without approval

5.2 WEEKLY LOSS LIMITS
----------------------

PURPOSE:
Prevent sustained losses over multiple days

TYPICAL SETTING:
2.5-4x daily limit

Example:
Daily limit = -$50K
Weekly limit = -$150K (3x daily)

RATIONALE:
- Allows bad days without immediate career threat
- But prevents persistent losses
- Multiple bad days = bigger problem than single bad day

ROLLING vs. CALENDAR:

CALENDAR WEEKLY:
Monday-Friday loss limit
Resets each Monday

ROLLING 7-DAY:
Any consecutive 7 trading days
More conservative
Harder to game

Recommendation: Rolling 7-day

ENFORCEMENT:

At weekly limit breach:
1. Trading suspended for remainder of week
2. Mandatory review with risk management
3. Mandatory review with trading management
4. Analysis of what went wrong
5. Action plan required before resuming
6. Possible reduction of limits
7. Possible temporary suspension

5.3 MONTHLY LOSS LIMITS
-----------------------

PURPOSE:
Strategic review trigger

TYPICAL SETTING:
5-10% of capital

Example:
Capital = $5M
Monthly limit = -$300K (6%)

SIGNIFICANCE:
Breaching monthly limit is serious
Indicates:
- Strategies not working
- Market conditions unsuitable
- Risk management failure
- Possible skill mismatch

CONSEQUENCES:

Immediate:
1. Trading suspended for remainder of month
2. Comprehensive review required
3. Senior management involvement
4. Analysis of all strategies
5. Risk assessment

Medium-term:
6. Possible capital reduction
7. Limit reductions
8. Strategy changes required
9. Potential reassignment
10. Performance improvement plan

Long-term:
- Multiple monthly breaches = serious career issue
- May result in termination
- Not acceptable for sustained success

5.4 MAXIMUM DRAWDOWN LIMITS
---------------------------

PURPOSE:
Limit peak-to-trough decline

DEFINITION:
Maximum loss from peak equity

CALCULATION:

Track high-water mark:
Starting Capital: $5,000,000
After Month 1: $5,200,000 (new HWM)
After Month 2: $5,100,000
Drawdown = ($5,200,000 - $5,100,000) / $5,200,000 = 1.9%

TYPICAL LIMITS:

Conservative: 10% max drawdown
Moderate: 15% max drawdown
Aggressive: 20-25% max drawdown

Example:
High Water Mark: $5,200,000
Max Drawdown: 15%
Minimum Equity: $5,200,000 × 0.85 = $4,420,000

If equity falls to $4,420,000:
- Trading suspended
- Major review required
- Significant implications

TIME CONSIDERATION:

Also consider recovery time:

Acceptable:
- 10% drawdown recovered in 2 weeks

Concerning:
- 10% drawdown persisting for 2+ months

Recovery Time Limits:
- If in max drawdown > 3 months
- Serious review required
- May need strategy overhaul

5.5 STOP-LOSS MECHANISMS
------------------------

PURPOSE:
Limit loss on individual positions

TYPES:

HARD STOP:
Fixed price level
Automatic execution

Example:
Buy at $100
Hard stop at $98
Max loss = $2 per share

TRAILING STOP:
Moves with favorable price action
Locks in profits

Example:
Buy at $100
Trailing stop = $2
Price rises to $105
Stop now at $103
Max loss from peak = $2

TIME STOP:
Close position after time period

Example:
Enter at 10:00 AM
Time stop = 2 hours
Auto-close at 12:00 PM regardless of P&L

VOLATILITY STOP:
Based on ATR (Average True Range)

Example:
Current ATR = $3
Stop = 2 × ATR = $6 from entry

PERCENTAGE STOP:
Fixed percentage loss

Example:
Enter at $100
Percentage stop = 2%
Stop at $98

BEST PRACTICES:

1. Always use stops
2. Determine before entering
3. Place in system (not mental)
4. Don't move stops (except trailing)
5. Let stops do their job
6. Aggregate stops across portfolio

POSITION-LEVEL:
Each position has stop

PORTFOLIO-LEVEL:
If total unrealized < -$50K, close all positions

================================================================================
                    6. LEVERAGE AND EXPOSURE
================================================================================

6.1 LEVERAGE CALCULATIONS
-------------------------

GROSS LEVERAGE:
Total exposure / Capital

Example:
Long Positions: $12M
Short Positions: $8M
Capital: $5M
Gross Leverage = ($12M + $8M) / $5M = 4.0x

NET LEVERAGE:
Net exposure / Capital

Example:
Long Positions: $12M
Short Positions: $8M
Net Exposure: $4M long
Capital: $5M
Net Leverage = $4M / $5M = 0.8x

INTERPRETATION:
- Gross leverage = total activity level
- Net leverage = directional exposure
- Both matter for different reasons

6.2 GROSS VS. NET EXPOSURE
--------------------------

GROSS EXPOSURE:

Relevance:
- Operational complexity
- Execution risk
- Operational capacity
- Transaction costs
- Monitoring requirements

High gross exposure means:
+ More trading activity
+ More positions to monitor
+ Higher transaction costs
- More complexity
- Greater operational risk

NET EXPOSURE:

Relevance:
- Directional market risk
- Beta exposure
- Market sensitivity
- Correlation to indices

High net exposure means:
+ Larger bet on market direction
- More market risk
- Higher correlation to market
- Less hedged

IDEAL FOR DIFFERENT STRATEGIES:

Market Making:
- High gross (5-10x)
- Low net (0-1x)

Statistical Arbitrage:
- Moderate gross (2-5x)
- Very low net (0-0.5x)

Momentum:
- Moderate gross (1.5-3x)
- Moderate net (0.5-2x)

Mean Reversion:
- Moderate gross (2-3x)
- Low net (0.3-1x)

6.3 RISK-ADJUSTED EXPOSURE
--------------------------

CONCEPT:
Adjust for volatility when calculating exposure

FORMULA:
Risk-Adjusted Exposure = Position Value × Volatility / Target Volatility

Example:
Position A: $1M, Vol 20%
Position B: $1M, Vol 40%
Target Vol: 20%

Risk-Adjusted:
Position A: $1M × (20/20) = $1M
Position B: $1M × (40/20) = $2M

Position B has 2x the risk-adjusted exposure

PORTFOLIO RISK-ADJUSTED EXPOSURE:
Sum risk-adjusted exposures

More accurate measure of risk than dollar exposure

USE FOR:
- Setting leverage limits
- Comparing across time periods
- Stress testing
- Risk budgeting

6.4 MARGIN REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

MARGIN BASICS:

INITIAL MARGIN:
Required to open position
Typically 25-50% for stocks (Reg T = 50%)

MAINTENANCE MARGIN:
Required to keep position open
Typically 25% for stocks

MARGIN CALL:
If equity falls below maintenance margin
Must add capital or close positions

PORTFOLIO MARGIN:
More sophisticated calculation
Based on portfolio risk
Can allow higher leverage
Requires approval and larger capital

MARGIN LIMIT SETTING:

Don't use 100% of available margin
Leave buffer for:
- Market moves (avoid margin call)
- New opportunities
- Operational safety

RECOMMENDED:
Use max 70-80% of available margin

Example:
Capital: $5M
Reg T Buying Power: $10M (2:1)
Your Limit: $7M-$8M (leave buffer)

MONITOR:
- Available margin continuously
- Projected margin impact of positions
- Margin calls avoided proactively

6.5 LEVERAGE LIMITS BY EXPERIENCE
---------------------------------

NEW TRADER:
Limit: 1.5-2.0x gross leverage

Rationale:
- Learning phase
- Build skills safely
- Mistakes will happen
- Protect career

Example:
Capital: $1M
Max Gross: $2M
Max Net: $500K

JUNIOR TRADER:
Limit: 2.0-3.0x gross leverage

Rationale:
- Basic competence proven
- Some track record
- Moderate autonomy
- Still developing

Example:
Capital: $2M
Max Gross: $6M
Max Net: $1M

EXPERIENCED TRADER:
Limit: 3.0-5.0x gross leverage

Rationale:
- Strong track record
- Proven risk management
- Full autonomy
- Consistent performance

Example:
Capital: $5M
Max Gross: $20M
Max Net: $2.5M

SENIOR TRADER:
Limit: 5.0-10.0x gross leverage

Rationale:
- Exceptional track record
- Expert risk management
- Strategic value
- Rare achievement level

Example:
Capital: $10M
Max Gross: $75M
Max Net: $5M

STRATEGY MODIFIERS:

Market Making: +2-3x on base limit
Stat Arb: +1-2x on base limit
Momentum: +0-1x on base limit
Mean Reversion: +0.5-1.5x on base limit

Example:
Experienced Trader base: 4x
Strategy: Market Making modifier: +3x
Effective limit: 7x gross leverage

================================================================================
                7. CONCENTRATION AND DIVERSIFICATION
================================================================================

7.1 SINGLE POSITION CONCENTRATION
---------------------------------

PURPOSE:
Prevent excessive dependence on single position

TYPICAL LIMIT:
20-35% of portfolio value in single position

CALCULATION:

Example:
Portfolio Value: $5M
Concentration Limit: 25%
Max Single Position: $1.25M

Current Largest Position: $1.5M (30%)
Status: BREACH ✗
Action Required: Reduce by $250K

EXCEPTIONS:

High-Conviction Positions:
- May allow 35-40% with approval
- Must have strong rationale
- Enhanced monitoring
- Clear exit plan

Low-Volatility Positions:
- May allow larger size
- If vol-adjusted risk appropriate

MONITORING:

Real-time tracking
Alert at 90% of limit (at 23% if limit is 25%)
Hard stop at limit
Cannot add to position if at limit

7.2 SECTOR CONCENTRATION
------------------------

PURPOSE:
Diversification across sectors

TYPICAL LIMIT:
30-40% max in any single sector

SECTOR DEFINITIONS:
Use standard taxonomy (GICS):
1. Information Technology
2. Healthcare
3. Financials
4. Consumer Discretionary
5. Industrials
6. Consumer Staples
7. Energy
8. Utilities
9. Real Estate
10. Materials
11. Communication Services

EXAMPLE:

Portfolio: $5M
Sector Limit: 35% = $1.75M

Current Allocation:
- Technology: $1.6M (32% - OK)
- Healthcare: $1.3M (26% - OK)
- Financials: $1.0M (20% - OK)
- Consumer: $900K (18% - OK)
- Other: $200K (4% - OK)

Well-diversified ✓

CORRELATED SECTORS:

Some sectors correlate highly:
- Financials + Real Estate
- Energy + Materials
- Tech + Communications

Consider combined limits:
- If correlation > 0.6
- Combined limit 50%

7.3 FACTOR CONCENTRATION
-----------------------

PURPOSE:
Diversification across risk factors

COMMON FACTORS:
- Value
- Momentum
- Size (Small cap vs. Large cap)
- Quality
- Low Volatility
- Dividend Yield

FACTOR EXPOSURE LIMITS:

Typical: ±2.0 on any single factor

INTERPRETATION:
Factor Exposure = Portfolio weighted beta to factor

+2.0 = Portfolio twice as exposed as market
-2.0 = Portfolio opposite exposure 2x
0 = Neutral

EXAMPLE:

Momentum Factor Exposure:
Your Portfolio Momentum: +1.8
Limit: ±2.0
Status: OK (high momentum tilt, but within limit)

Value Factor Exposure:
Your Portfolio Value: -0.5
Limit: ±2.0
Status: OK (slight growth tilt)

MONITORING:
- Daily factor exposure calculation
- Factor attribution of returns
- Factor correlation analysis

REBALANCING:
If factor exposure at limit:
- Avoid adding positions with same factor tilt
- Add opposite factor to rebalance
- Close concentrated positions

7.4 CORRELATION-BASED LIMITS
----------------------------

PURPOSE:
Prevent pseudo-diversification

CONCEPT:
Holding multiple positions that move together
provides less diversification than it appears

LIMIT SETTING:

Measure correlation:
- Calculate rolling 30-60 day correlation
- Identify highly correlated pairs (ρ > 0.7)
- Limit combined size of correlated positions

EXAMPLE:

Stock A and Stock B correlation = 0.85
Treat as highly correlated

Individual Limits: $1M each
Combined Limit: $1.5M (not $2M)

Currently Hold:
Stock A: $800K
Stock B: $800K
Total: $1.6M (exceeds $1.5M limit) ✗

Action: Reduce combined exposure by $100K

CORRELATION MATRIX:

For portfolio with many positions:
- Generate correlation matrix
- Identify clusters of correlated positions
- Apply cluster-level limits

Cluster Example:
Tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)
All correlate 0.6-0.8
Combined limit: 40% of portfolio

7.5 DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

MINIMUM DIVERSIFICATION:

POSITION COUNT:
Minimum positions for diversification

Conservative: 15-20 positions minimum
Moderate: 10-15 positions minimum
Concentrated: 5-10 positions minimum

MORE POSITIONS:
- Better diversification
- Lower concentration risk
- Smoother returns
- BUT: More complexity, harder to monitor

SECTOR COVERAGE:
Minimum sectors for diversification

Requirement: At least 3 sectors
Better: At least 5 sectors
Best: Representation across 7+ sectors

STRATEGY DIVERSITY:
Multiple strategies with low correlation

Requirement: At least 2 strategy types
Better: 3-4 strategy types
Best: 4-5 complementary strategies

MONITORING:

Portfolio Concentration Metrics:

Herfindahl Index:
H = Σ (wi)²

where wi = weight of position i

Lower = more diversified
H = 1.0 = one position (max concentration)
H = 0.1 = ten equal positions
H = 0.05 = twenty equal positions

Target: H < 0.15 (equivalent to ~7 equal positions)

ALERT:
If H > 0.2 (concentrated)
Action: Diversify

================================================================================
                     8. ADVANCED RISK METRICS
================================================================================

8.1 VALUE AT RISK (VaR)
-----------------------

DEFINITION:
Maximum expected loss at given confidence level over time horizon

INTERPRETATION:
95% 1-day VaR = $75,000 means:
"95% confident losses won't exceed $75K in one day"
Or: "Expect to lose more than $75K on 1 out of 20 days"

CALCULATION METHODS:

HISTORICAL VaR:
- Use historical returns
- Sort returns
- Find 5th percentile (for 95% confidence)

Example:
100 days of historical returns
Sort from worst to best
5th worst day = -$73,000
VaR (95%) = $73,000

PARAMETRIC VaR:
- Assume normal distribution
- VaR = Portfolio Value × Volatility × Z-score × √time

Example:
Portfolio: $5M
Daily Volatility: 1.5%
Z-score for 95%: 1.65

VaR (95%, 1-day) = $5M × 0.015 × 1.65 = $123,750

MONTE CARLO VaR:
- Simulate thousands of scenarios
- Find 5th percentile of outcomes

SETTING LIMITS:

VaR Limit Example:
"1-day 95% VaR shall not exceed $100,000"

Current VaR = $85,000 ✓ (within limit)
If VaR reaches $105,000 ✗ (must reduce positions)

USAGE:
- Daily VaR monitoring
- Compare to daily loss limit
- Adjust positions to maintain VaR within limit
- Report to risk management

8.2 CONDITIONAL VaR (CVaR / ES)
-------------------------------

DEFINITION:
Expected loss given VaR is exceeded
Also called Expected Shortfall (ES)

INTERPRETATION:
If 95% VaR = $75K
And 95% CVaR = $95K

Means: "When we lose more than $75K (5% of times),
average loss is $95K"

CALCULATION:

Historical CVaR:
- Take all losses exceeding VaR threshold
- Calculate average

Example:
VaR (95%) = $73K
Days exceeding: -$73K, -$85K, -$92K, -$110K, -$88K
CVaR = Average = $89.6K

IMPORTANCE:
CVaR captures tail risk better than VaR
VaR says nothing about how bad "bad" can be
CVaR tells expected loss in tail

LIMIT SETTING:

CVaR Limit Example:
"95% CVaR shall not exceed 1.5× daily loss limit"

Daily Loss Limit: -$50K
CVaR Limit: -$75K

Current CVaR: -$68K ✓

8.3 STRESS TESTING
------------------

PURPOSE:
Test portfolio under extreme scenarios

STANDARD SCENARIOS:

2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS:
- Market down 40%
- Volatility spike to VIX 80
- Credit spreads blow out
- Correlations go to 1.0

Expected Impact on Your Portfolio:
Run simulation, estimate loss

FLASH CRASH:
- Market drops 10% in minutes
- Then recovers 5%
- Liquidity evaporates

Expected Impact:
- Estimate slippage costs
- Unable to exit positions
- Forced liquidations

SECTOR COLLAPSE:
- One sector drops 25%
- Example: Tech selloff

Expected Impact:
- Loss on tech positions
- Correlation effects

VOLATILITY EXPLOSION:
- VIX doubles from 15 to 30
- Overnight gap

Expected Impact:
- Position revaluation
- Stop losses gapped through

CUSTOM SCENARIOS:
Create scenarios specific to your portfolio

Example:
"What if top 3 positions each drop 10%?"

STRESS TEST FREQUENCY:

Daily: Quick stress test of current portfolio
Weekly: Comprehensive stress test suite
Monthly: Deep scenario analysis
Quarterly: Update scenarios, add new ones

LIMITS BASED ON STRESS TESTS:

Example Limit:
"2008 scenario loss shall not exceed 15% of capital"

Capital: $5M
Max loss in 2008 scenario: $750K

Run stress test:
Estimated loss in 2008 scenario: $680K ✓ (within limit)

If projected loss exceeds limit:
- Must reduce positions
- Change portfolio composition
- Hedge risks

8.4 SCENARIO ANALYSIS
---------------------

FORWARD-LOOKING SCENARIOS:

Unlike stress testing (historical events),
scenario analysis looks at plausible future events

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:

Fed Rate Increase:
- Fed raises rates 0.5%
- Impact on:
  * Growth stocks (negative)
  * Financials (positive)
  * Bonds (negative)
- Estimate portfolio impact

Earnings Miss:
- Major holding misses earnings by 20%
- Stock drops 15%
- Calculate position impact
- Contagion to similar stocks

Geopolitical Event:
- Major geopolitical crisis
- Risk-off move
- Estimate impact

Regulatory Change:
- New regulation affects sector
- Example: New tech regulation
- Impact on tech holdings

PROCESS:

For Each Scenario:
1. Define scenario clearly
2. Estimate impact on each position
3. Consider correlations and second-order effects
4. Calculate total portfolio impact
5. Assess if within risk tolerance
6. If not, adjust portfolio

SCENARIO PROBABILITY:

Weight scenarios by probability

Example:
Scenario A: 20% probability, -$100K impact
Scenario B: 5% probability, -$300K impact
Scenario C: 10% probability, -$50K impact

Expected Loss = 0.20×$100K + 0.05×$300K + 0.10×$50K
              = $20K + $15K + $5K = $40K

8.5 GREEKS AND SENSITIVITIES
----------------------------

For options positions and sensitivity analysis:

DELTA:
Change in position value per $1 change in underlying

Portfolio Delta = Sum of position deltas
Measures directional exposure

Delta Limit Example:
"Portfolio delta shall not exceed $100K"
(Equivalent to $100K of directional exposure)

GAMMA:
Rate of change of delta

High gamma = delta changes quickly
Risk: Large moves cause large delta changes

Gamma Limit:
"Portfolio gamma shall not exceed 1000"

VEGA:
Sensitivity to volatility changes

Portfolio Vega = $15,000 means:
Portfolio gains $15K if vol increases 1%

Vega Limit:
"Portfolio vega shall not exceed $25,000"

THETA:
Time decay

Measures daily P&L from time passing

Theta = -$2,000 means:
Lose $2K per day from time decay (if nothing else changes)

MONITORING:
- Calculate greeks daily
- Track against limits
- Hedge when approaching limits
- Understand exposures

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS:

Portfolio Sensitivity to:
- Market level (beta)
- Volatility (vega)
- Time (theta)
- Interest rates (rho)
- Specific factors

Example Summary:
"+1% market move → Portfolio gains $35K"
"+1% vol increase → Portfolio gains $12K"
"-1 day → Portfolio loses $2K (theta)"

================================================================================
                   9. DYNAMIC RISK ADJUSTMENT
================================================================================

9.1 MARKET VOLATILITY ADJUSTMENTS
---------------------------------

CONCEPT:
Adjust limits based on current volatility

VIX-BASED ADJUSTMENTS:

RULE SET:

VIX < 15 (Low Vol):
- Increase position limits by 10%
- Increase leverage limit by 0.5x
- Normal daily loss limit

Example:
Base Position Limit: $1M
Adjusted: $1.1M

VIX 15-20 (Normal Vol):
- Standard limits

VIX 20-30 (Elevated Vol):
- Reduce position limits by 20%
- Reduce leverage by 1x
- Reduce daily loss limit by 20%

Example:
Base Position Limit: $1M
Adjusted: $800K

VIX 30-40 (High Vol):
- Reduce position limits by 40%
- Reduce leverage by 2x
- Reduce daily loss limit by 40%

Example:
Base Position Limit: $1M
Adjusted: $600K

VIX > 40 (Extreme Vol):
- Reduce position limits by 60%
- Reduce leverage by 3x
- Reduce daily loss limit by 50%
- Consider stopping trading

Example:
Base Position Limit: $1M
Adjusted: $400K

REALIZED VOL ADJUSTMENTS:

Instead of VIX, use realized portfolio volatility:

IF Portfolio Vol < Target Vol:
- Can increase positions slightly

IF Portfolio Vol > Target Vol:
- Must reduce positions

Example:
Target Portfolio Vol: 15% annualized
Current Portfolio Vol: 22% annualized
Adjustment Factor: 15/22 = 0.68
Reduce positions to 68% of normal

DYNAMIC IMPLEMENTATION:

Automated System:
- Calculates vol adjustment factor
- Applies to all position limits
- Updates every hour or continuously
- Trader notification of changes

9.2 PERFORMANCE-BASED ADJUSTMENTS
---------------------------------

CONCEPT:
Adjust limits based on recent performance

WINNING STREAK ADJUSTMENTS:

Consecutive Winning Days:
5+ winning days → Consider +10-15% increase
10+ winning days → Max +20% increase

BUT:
- Don't get overconfident
- Maximum increase capped at +20%
- Review carefully
- Ensure not just luck

Example:
10 winning days in a row
Average daily profit: $25K
Base daily loss limit: -$50K
Adjusted: -$60K (+20%)

LOSING STREAK ADJUSTMENTS:

Consecutive Losing Days:
3+ losing days → -20% reduction
5+ losing days → -40% reduction
7+ losing days → -60% reduction
10+ losing days → Stop trading, full review

Example:
5 losing days in a row
Base daily loss limit: -$50K
Adjusted: -$30K (-40%)

DRAWDOWN-BASED ADJUSTMENTS:

Drawdown < 5%:
- Normal limits

Drawdown 5-10%:
- Reduce limits by 25%
- Enhanced monitoring

Drawdown 10-15%:
- Reduce limits by 50%
- Daily management review

Drawdown 15-20%:
- Reduce limits by 75%
- Survival mode
- Focus on capital preservation

Drawdown > 20%:
- Stop trading
- Full review required
- Restart only with approval

Example:
Capital High Water Mark: $5.2M
Current Capital: $4.6M
Drawdown: 11.5%

Action:
Base Limits: Reduced by 50%
Daily Loss Limit: -$50K → -$25K
Position Limits: 50% of normal

SHARPE RATIO ADJUSTMENTS:

Recent Sharpe (last 30 days):
> 3.0 → Can increase limits +10%
2.0-3.0 → Normal limits
1.5-2.0 → Maintain or slightly reduce
1.0-1.5 → Reduce limits by 20%
< 1.0 → Reduce limits by 40%

9.3 TIME-OF-DAY ADJUSTMENTS
---------------------------

CONCEPT:
Different risk appropriate at different times

INTRADAY SCHEDULE:

09:30-09:45 (Market Open):
- High volatility period
- Reduce position sizes by 30-50%

================================================================================
                              CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Risk parameters are not obstacles - they are enablers. They allow you to trade
with confidence, knowing your downside is protected. They prevent emotional
decisions during stressful times. They create a framework for sustainable success.

KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER:

1. LIMITS EXIST TO PROTECT YOU
   - Your career
   - Your capital
   - Your psychology

2. NEVER OVERRIDE LIMITS
   - They exist for a reason
   - Respect them always
   - Seek approval for changes through proper process

3. LIMITS SHOULD EVOLVE
   - As you gain experience
   - As your track record develops
   - As market conditions change
   - Through proper channels

4. PREVENTION BETTER THAN RECOVERY
   - Stop small losses from becoming large
   - One career-ending loss can happen
   - Respect daily limits religiously

5. RISK MANAGEMENT IS EDGE
   - Surviving is winning
   - Consistency compounds
   - Blow-ups end careers

If ever in doubt about risk limits, choose the more conservative option.
You can always increase limits later with a good track record.
You cannot undo a catastrophic loss.
